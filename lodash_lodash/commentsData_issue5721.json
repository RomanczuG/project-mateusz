I don't expect the impact to be large, but it's painless to communicate it to folks just as you would any part of your software you are deprecating.\r\n\r\nOverall (super IMO, and \"this is just like how I feel, man\") I believe high quality software should provide an upgrade path to its users as well as deprecation warnings, whenever possible.

    "body": "@jdalton \r\n> Check out [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/) it has a built-in test runner bun test that mimics jest API and works with ESM. \r\n\r\n(assuming here that you were suggesting folks consuming a lodash only ESM v5 switch to bun for testing)\r\n\r\nWhy use the stick when you can use the carrot? This may be the path people end up taking, but it won't happen overnight.\r\n\r\nI believe many projects will not opt into changing part of their test infrastructure, and will instead either transpile away the ESM or not take the upgrades at all, reducing the reach in the ecosystem of all the improvements that are planned.\r\n\r\nThe \"carrot\" here would be letting folks know that lodash is moving into the future, and they can come along by upgrading incrementally.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I won't be angry if this is not the direction that is taken. My goal here is to start a conversation and put forth options ❤️",
