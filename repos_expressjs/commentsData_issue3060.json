If you receive 304 status for the browser the response is not changed and you cannot display updated data. \nJust in case try to set the response status as below:\n\n```\nres.status(200).json(yourResponse);\n```\n\nIn the client side i personally do not call recursively getUsage function \nI hope I was helpful\nNick\n",

Debugging the network I can clearly see Express returned status 200 with the correct json data that I queried from the database.  I am at a loss to why angular is ignoring it still.
