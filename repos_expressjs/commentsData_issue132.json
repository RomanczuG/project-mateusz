    "body": "Regarding your first problem: You need to call the \"node app.js\" from the express folder, not the example folder. This is because node tries to require() files relative to the working directory.\n\nAlso, it seems you are still running on an old node version. You should update from 0.1.24 to 0.1.25.\nBut I doubt, that this has anything to do with your <script>/redirect problems. No idea about those.\n",

By using \"git submodule update( --init)\" you will only get that specific revision. This is intended. You should not manually update your local haml submodule unless you really know that you want to do just that, which in this case you don't.\nJust to clear that up ;)\n",
