    "body": "Yea, I know. But since express may have been installed on a machine a while ago, it may be connect `1.8.0` or `1.8.1`, in which case there is no `req.files` property and the files are just intermingled in `req.body`. It is really just a problem because the code may be deployed to all kind of machines and even when I have my `package.json` set to the latest version of express, `npm install` will not upgrade the inner connect within express if it is already express `2.5.2`. `npm update` may or may not update the inner connect, depending on if that machine's local npm cache state (since they are not connected to the Internet). Basically, there is no way I can make `npm install` or `npm update` fail if express's inner connect is not at least `1.8.2`.\n\nAnyway, I'll just take your answer on this. I just wanted to let you know why I was requesting the version bump (plus, connect changing some public API in the last dot release is kind of annoying, since it cause all my file uploading to stop working when some machines got connect 1.8.2).\n",
