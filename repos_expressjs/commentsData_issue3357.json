    "body": "Hi @webIcome sorry we all missed your pull request. It looks like the existing tests are all failing with your change, indicating this is likely not backwards-compatible (and based on what this is trying to accomplish). Since that would men this would need to land in 5.x or later and in he 5.x branch there is no longer any routing code part of this repository, I would suggest re-opening your pull request at https://github.com/pillarjs/router . Be sure to include tests as well :) !",
