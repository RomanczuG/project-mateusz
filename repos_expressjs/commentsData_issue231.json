I've been experimenting, but the only way I can get the server to \"run\" is to call the fully qualified run method \"Express.server.run\".  Coffee-script appears to also define a \"run\" method and they're stepping on one another.\n\nSeem that even \"Express\" shouldn't be introduced into the global scope unless I choose to put it there, should it?  That's the whole point of common.js requires.\n\nEX (coffee-script):\n\n```\nkiwi: require 'kiwi'\nex: kiwi.require 'express'\n\nex.get '/', ->\n  return 'Hello World'\nex.run\n```\n",
