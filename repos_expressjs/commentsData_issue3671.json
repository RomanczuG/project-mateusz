    "body": "This is because both `isClient` and `isAdmin` have been mounted on the path of `/`, so all requests will go through both, as all paths start with `/`.\r\n\r\nFrom your example above, let's walk through what happens with `GET /api/client/articles`:\r\n\r\n1. `app.use('/', articleClientRouter);` -- since `/api/client/articles` begins with `/`, enter into `articleClientRouter`.\r\n2. `router.use(authMiddleware.isClient);` -- since `/api/client/articles` begins with `/`, enter into `authMiddleware.isClient`.\r\n3. `router.get('/api/client/articles', articleController.getArticles);` -- since `GET /api/client/articles` matches, enter into `articleController.getArticles`. What this does is anyone's guess, because no code was provided. Let's assume it calls `next()` so we'll continue routing.\r\n4. Nothing left in router, exit back to top level\r\n5. `app.use('/', articleAdminRouter);` -- since `/api/client/articles` begins with `/`, enter into `articleAdminRouter`.\r\n6. `router.use(authMiddleware.isAdmin);` -- since  `/api/client/articles` begins with `/`, enter into `authMiddleware.isAdmin`.\r\n7. No routes match `GET /api/client/articles`, exit back to top level\r\n8. No routes left in top level, 404.\r\n",
