One could very easily and prematurely come to the conclusion that \"Node.js [is] in Flames\" which might cause unnecessary panic. I believe whoever posted this at Netflix had good intentions and didn't mean to cause this much buzz; but some parts of the article, especially the title, are misleading and negative towards node and express.\n",

How do I refresh routes in an Express app? (In fact, I'm suspicious that Netflix was modifying our private state instead of doing it correctly)\n2. How can I add hundreds of thousands of routes and scale with Express 4.x. I have several Express.js 4.x applications running in production right now with 2 million routes registered and a 404 (which is the worst case lookup) takes 12ms to respond.\n3. What are the reasons for the choice of a linear RegExp lookup in Expres.js? What kind of power does it give me?\n\nIt would also be lovely if I could get donations for this as well :) Since I get no pay from Express work.\n",

There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all framework. You must choose the framework that matches your use-case and even work environment. Express has always taken the position of ultimate flexibility. Yes, in certain environments it can cause issues due to the amount of power and lack of training/understanding. In return, the goal is there should not be a use-case that cannot be solved, though they may require writing and understanding code.\n\nExpress 4.x is more flexible than ever before and 5.x is set to improve that.\n",

The main issues surrounding is Express is\n1. Not enough quality guides, tutorials, etc.\n2. Too many old blog posts and articles about Express (especially 3.x) around on the Internet, getting re-posted and re-iterated non-stop. This is mainly because of it's popularity and as a tech writer, you need some click bait to your blog, or why not re-hash something about Express that may be pretty outdated and not even very good, am i rite ;)?\n",
