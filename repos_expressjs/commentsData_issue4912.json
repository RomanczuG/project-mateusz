    "body": "Hi @wll8 ! So the `app.use` function takes basically n-paths and then n-middlewares. When no paths are given, the default is `'/'`. This means that 1, 2, and 4 are all exactly the same in your example. But 3 uses the path `*`, which is a capture group, so though matches the same URLs, the entire URL is captured in `req.params[0]` and then the matched part (the entire URL) is trimmed off from `req.url`, leaving it as just `/`.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps!",
