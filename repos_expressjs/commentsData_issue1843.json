    "body": "> `app.` could inherit between routers\n\nnot sure what that means. it sounds like you think routers inherit settings from apps, which is incorrect. let me try to explain this more:\n\nright now, people do `app.use(subapp)` and expect `subapp` to inherit settings from `app`. i would expect this too... except when i don't want that to happen, i.e. if the subapp is an entirely different app whose settings should not be shared. \n\ninstead of adding 100 types of options to deal with these cases, it's easier just to have people mount routers like `app.use(router)`. now the router and all its middleware's app is `app`. `app.use(router)` is just adding more middleware. any middleware that is used by `app` that isn't another express instance will have `app`'s settings.\n\nthat is, there will never be inheritance when people do `app.use(subapp)` or `app.use(router)`, and we will document this specifically. i think \"no inheritance, ever\" is an easier concept to grasp than \"there's inheritance if you do this, but no inheritance when you do that\".\n\ndid that clear things up? do you have any cases (in code) that you need clarification on? \n",

    "body": "so... Router has no method `use`, or `set`...  I would like a sub app, with app inheritance.  for now, I will probably find the getter/setter attributes storage and deep extend that onto the newly created `express()` app.\n\nHere's what should be possible\n\n```\nparentApp = express();\n\nparentApp.set('views', join(__dirname, 'views'));\nparentApp.set('view engine', 'ect');\nparentApp.engine('ect', ectRenderer.render);\n\nparentApp.use('/', function(req, res, next){ res.send('Hey, index'); });\nparentApp.use('/childSection', require('./child_section')(parentApp));\n\n// In childSection/index.js\nmodule.exports = function(parentApp){\n  childApp = parentApp.child();\n  childApp.use(require('child_middleware'));\n  childApp.get('/', function(req, res, next){\n    res.render('childEctView');\n  });\n};\n```\n\nI'd rather not duplicate\n\n```\nparentApp.set('views', join(__dirname));\nparentApp.set('view engine', 'ect');\nparentApp.engine('ect', ectRenderer.render);\n```\n\nwithin `childSection/index.js`.\n\nI'm probably going to build my own `extend`er for this purpose, but it would be nice if we could treat express `app`s as instances of classes, which can be `extend`ed like any other class.  I surely am not going to set my views up repeatedly\n\n#### For these purposes\n\nI've hacked in\n\n```\n_.extend(subApp.settings, app.settings);\n_.extend(subApp.engines, app.engines);\n```\n\nIt seems to do what I was looking for, which is not duplicate view engine settings.\n\nMy view directory is not `/views`, it is `top`\n\ntop\n--index.js\n--views\n----index.ect\n----layout.ect\n--module1\n----views\n------index.ect\n\nThis way, i call `res.render('views/index')`, and `<% include 'views/layout' %>`.  I always assume this structure, so even within my `module1/views/index`, I can still call `<% include 'views/layout' %>`.\n",
