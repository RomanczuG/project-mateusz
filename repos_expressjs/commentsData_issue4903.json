    "body": "So I'll add up front this is not an API from Express, but rather from Node.js, and it's behavior has actually changed over time with rhe version of Node.js you are using -- and any answer from, say, the Express team is more hearsay, as it is really a question for those who wrtoe it: Node.js project.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you use above I would think is fine -- you are not doing anything that would create a memory leak.\r\n\r\nPersonally, though, I reach for https://github.com/jshttp/on-finished to do something after a request or response is finished as there are so many events in Node.js that get emitted under different conditions and the conditions they are emitted under are not the same across Node.js versions.\r\n\r\nEdit: sorry, I missed part of your question about removing listeners. For a req or res object, that is typically unnecessary unless you have something holding on to it for some time after you're done with it and want to slim down the footprint -- or, mainly, keep that event from executing if another event (the clean up) executed first. Event listeners added to an object are GCd when that object is GCd.",
