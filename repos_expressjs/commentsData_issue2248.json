I can see the same see-sawed pattern you do (Heap goes from `27MB` to `290MB` during runtime and after the test back to `82MB`). I am investigating more, what library is causing the leak. \n\nThe only thing I noticed is that RSS stays at `178MB`after the test (started with: 26MB). Just out of curiosity: Would `node-heapdump` module give me more insights about that part too?\n\nHuge thank for your help again!\n",

Do a third one to then see what stuff is still sitting there. That's the basics to how to use heapdumps to track down a teak.\n",
