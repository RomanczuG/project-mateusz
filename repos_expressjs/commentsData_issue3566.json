    "body": "Hi @caaker ! You can find the changelog for Express 5.0.0-alpha.2 here: https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/5.0.0-alpha.2 That version is based on Express 4.13.1 so wouldn't include anything added to Express 4.x after that release. As soon as there is a new Express 5.0 alpha based on 4.16.0 or higher, that change will be within the 5.0.0 alpha series. I hope that helps!",

    "body": "It sounds to me like you are saying the current alpha is based on 4.13.1 and that as it moves forward it will be based on 4.16 or higher which will once again add body parsing back into the Express core.\r\n\r\nIs this a summary of what you are saying?  \r\n\r\nI'm asking b.c. I have installed body parsing middleware, upgraded to 4.16, removed body parsing middleware, upgraded to 5.0, added body parsing middleware, which is were I am at now.\r\n\r\nAnd if I understand you correctly, once it is put back in again.  I will need to upgrade and remove it again.\r\n\r\nNot something I want to spend time doing necessarily.  \r\n\r\nMy question, is what is the end goal, to have body parsing as part of the Express core or to have it as middleware that is installed.  That way I can just pick one or the other and leave it alone.\r\n\r\nSorry if my question/concern was unclear or overly verbose.  Hopefully this clarifies.",

    "body": "Gotcha. So like many large projects, there are multiple major version in active develop in parallel. What happens is new features are added first to the \"mainline\" version which is 4.x in this case and then ported to the development (or maintenance) versions. 5.x is the development version so it gets thr code line frlm 4.x merged into 5.0 after a 4.x release. They can sometime lag because alpha is for 5.0 code preview. Once they become betas or especially rc to stable both majors would have releases the same day to keep in step. I hope this makes sense.",

    "body": "This makes sense.  Hmm ... it seems I got the install directions directly from [Migrating to Express 5](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html) which actually has you migrate to something created in 2015 ( per your comment ).  It  seems to incorrectly state that you are updating to the latest alpha ...\r\n\r\n> To install the latest alpha and to preview Express 5, enter the following command in your application root directory:\r\n\r\n`$ npm install express@5.0.0-alpha.2 --save\r\n`\r\n\r\nI think it was this line that caused all the back and forth.  Is there a way to update it.  I.e is there a way to tell npm to install the latest alpha?  I'm not sure if npm has this option/capability or if the comment above the command needs to be modified.   \r\n\r\nPerhaps it was stated correctly when the document was written, I would guess 2015, but as of now it is misleading or incorrect, and if you are just reading this document, might make you believe you were upgrading to something created in 2018.",
