The reason behind this is that I like to setup a certain set of routes to happen before general middleware like session, cookie, etc. This allows me to group those types of routes into something easily exportable from files/modules to be included in the main 'app'\n",

    "body": "you can still do stuff like `app.all('*', middleware)`, but yeah generally I agree. It's very convenient the way it is and the only downside to having several routers is that settings and the other app prototype methods would not be available. This almost gets back to subapps acting as additional routers, there's no additional overhead in doing this and settings are inherited \n",
