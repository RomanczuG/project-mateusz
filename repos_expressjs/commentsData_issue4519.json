    "body": "Hi @ShubhankarKG thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately it is not that simple as there are many, many ways one can write a body, and not all those ways are with our helper methods. Maintaining a `res.body` at the framework would understandably be expected to have whatever the response body was, even if the response was a 10GB file.\r\n\r\nThe ability to save the response body is going to be dependent on the application.\r\n\r\nThankfully, Express is very flexible and allows you to make you app automatically save the value given the `res.json` if that is what you would like to have happen. The following can be added to your app definition, for example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.response.json = (function (json) {\r\n  return function (body) {\r\n    this.locals.cache = body\r\n    return json.call(this, body)\r\n  }\r\n}(app.response.body))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to write the above; pulling in a AOP lib would make it more straight forward, even.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.",
