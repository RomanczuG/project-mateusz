    "body": "I'm not sure whether this feature should be in express or connect, as express has the ability to mount one application to another, like following: \n\n```\nvar app = express();\nvar submodule = express();\napp.use('/subpath', submodule);\n```\n\nthat's great, and can make file easily to managed. But unfortunately, this way is not work perfect in many situations. for example:\n\n```\nvar app = express();\nvar submodule = express();\napp.use('/submodule/:param', submodule);\n```\n\nThen this will only match exactly '/submodule/:param' but not '/submodule/xxx'. yes, I can do it like: \n\n```\napp.use(''/submodule', function(..)  { \n      ... anything that handle the param by my self\n});\n```\n\nthe function is easy. but if express is targeting to make application modular and advise people to use mount, then that feature is one I prefer to be made inside express ranther than project code.\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nin previous versions of express, posted objects were converted to array (I don't know if each time, but in more 'complex' posts that happened). For example, if you posted object with data at index 100, it was converted on server side to array, with 100 empty inserts and posted insert at index 100. Although it this was not ok it at least worked.\nBut now with latest update (maybe it broke before), this is not working any more.\n\nhow to reproduce:\n1. route\n   app.post('/test', function(req, res){\n   console.log(req.body.blah[50]);\n   console.log(req.body.blah);\n   });\n2. post\n   from client, do a post (I'm using jquery for test):\n   $.post('/test', {blah: {50: [{b: 1},{a:2}]}})\n\nRESULT:\nexpress v3.3.5, console logs\n\nundefined\n[ [ { b: '1' }, { a: '2' } ]]\n\nproblem is, that 'blah' object is converted into array and not indexed properly any more, which makes our code break.\n\nexpress v3.0.0-rc5, console logs:\n\n[ { b: '1' }, { a: '2' } ]\n[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,....., [ { b: '1' }, { a: '2' } ]]\n\nthis at least works, if you expect data at certain index (in this case 50).\n",

Based on the above behavior it seems like this assumption is incorrect.\n\nCan anyone explain what is happening on the back end when I log in/out and why the same session id works after I log out and then back in?\n",

    "body": "It would be nice to be able to install middleware that gets fired immediately before invoking the route (but after the route is matched). It would be very similar to app.param(), but it would always be invoked (e.g. app.preroute(fn)).\n\nPeople could use it for whatever, but the common case, at least for me, would be to load the path's dependencies asynchronously.\n\nMost examples out there handle http://example.com/:foo?bar=baz by fetching the logged in user during auth deserialization, then loading :foo via app.param, then loading baz in the controller. I find that more often than not, the viewer, :foo, and baz are mutually exclusive and io bound, and thus should be loaded asynchronously. Something like app.preroute() would facilitate this.\n\nThe way I handle it right now is to not fetch during auth deserialization, never use app.param, and every route looks like `app.<method>(<path>, load, <controller>)`. It'd be preferable to just do `app.preroute(load)` once, and it might encourage others to be wary of the fact that middleware gets run serially!\n",

    "body": "I think it would greatly benefit the API to have exposed methods for removing and adding routes during runtime.\n\nI can see a lot of use cases for adding/removing new routes based on general CMS housekeeping. Although, at the moment, you can technically remove/add routes by hijacking the map object, there are no certainties that future versions of Express will not break core functionality: functionality which, IMO, could be at the heart of any CMS built around Express.\n\nIs the lack of this feature due to performance concerns in re-routing, an aim to keep Express as a loose framework, or simply an oversight of the possibilities?\n\nI would be happy to have a crack at implementation but thought I should first put the stink out and see if anybody gags...\n\nThanks,\nShennan\n",

But it's a Web Application Framework.  so is Drupal, WebLogic, RoR, .NET, apache, jQuery, Backbone.js, nginx, and Python.  But all of those are very diverse - in many cases complementary.  You need to nail down some specifics that tell me what to expect (and whether to bother to download it and try it out).\n\nWhat does express have in it?  \"A robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications\"  The same is true for Drupal, WebLogic, RoR, .NET, apache, jQuery, Backbone.js, nginx, and Python.  But the way you do it, and your capabilities, vary from one of those to another; eg Drupal must run on top of PHP which often runs on top of Apache.  You can build your website on raw apache, is that like express?  Are there tons of forms to fill out like Drupal?  I'm getting no such answers from the front page; it's all marketing fluff.\n\nTry something like these\n\nexpress takes the place of apache because it's the direct web server, streamlining something.  It provides an environment where you can use (what languages) with (smarty? mustache?) to generate your web pages.\n\nUsing Node.js's network interfaces, express serves web pages directly on the net, without the need for a lumbering server like Apache.  a\n\nwhat else I dunno I just started on it.  Needs specifics. Your market is programmers,  probably not brainless suits.\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nCurrently express is using cwd() as default way of finding a view. If developer is unaware of this, she might install the application in production and depending on where the process was started from application can either break or even worse start serving out wrong files, which poses a security risk.\n\nWould it be possible to remove this default and require developers to specify the views or application's root explicitly rather then assuming the application root is at cwd()?\n\nIn production it is simply never the case, since any daemon tool would set cwd = '/'.\n\nI refer to this line:\nthis.set('views', process.cwd() + '/views'); \n\nThanks,\nDenis\n",

Since express.limit() works by checking the headers for the file size, you can work around it.  If you modify the headers and set 'content-type' to below the size limit, you will be able to upload the file.  I used the python requests library to do this, but I am sure there are simpler ways.  \n\nHere is the code for the express.limit middleware: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/middleware/limit.js#L31\n\nAnd here is how I exploited it in python:\nrequests.post('http://localhost/upload',files={'filename':open('mutt.txt','r')},headers={'content-length':'1'})\n",

One example would be if the request has a specific header. I'd like to configure express so that all requests that has a header `Accept: application/json` passes through a certain chain of middleware since (in my application) this means that the request is for data in the database. Requests that accept `text/html` could go through other middleware since I know that this is another type of request that serves a different purpose.\n\nToday I have to prefix all my database requests with a certain path.

    "body": "When mounting an express app from another app, the first (child) app must be created before it ever has any knowledge of the existence of the parent, meaning the settings do not get inherited until after it has been mounted. This makes it difficult if there is other functionality that must be set up ahead of time that requires information contained in the settings of its parent. One possible solution I thought of would be to use the 'mount' event and get the setting then, however due to the design of my application, I have an express app mount an express app which mounts an express app and therefore the system doesn't propagate the settings down the chain to the most deep express app, and the mount event is actually too early to know the settings. \n\nWould you consider adding something to future versions of express to deal with this issue? \n",

    "body": "Hello,\n\nAt the moment, while Express version 3.3.2 and version 3.3.3 are out in the npm registry, those versions are not tagged in the Git repository. Tags may be \"annoying to maintain\" (please note the official quote ;-) ) when they are not part of an automated process.\n\nSo here I propose you a script to ease version name bump and tag.\n\nPlease note that this script enforces the SemVerTag sub-spec (because this is the convention I use for the projects I work on and from where this script is coming):\nversion names are like \"3.3.4\" (semver compliant) and that tag names are like \"v3.3.4\".\n\nAlso note that recently the SemVerTag sub-spec has been removed from the SemVer spec but only to have the SemVer reach the widest possible consensus https://github.com/mojombo/semver.org/issues/42 but SemVerTag is still relevant and useful cf. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2006265/is-there-an-standard-naming-convention-for-git-tags\n\nIf following SemVerTag is not what you want, I can modify the script so that version names and version tags are of the same form. Please let me know.\n\nBest, (and thank you for Express!)\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm using [esri-leaflet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet) which is consuming [this](http://citybikes-ags.aws.af.cm/rest/services/citibikenyc/FeatureServer/0/query?f=json) ExpressJS service I've written. It uses jsonp. Here's an example of the `callback` parameter:\n\n`L.esri._callbacks['callback_9moie5.ef6vpshsemi']`\n\nNow, ExpressJS explicitly strips out the `'` characters from that, which causes the esri-leaflet client to fail when it gets the response from my service.\n\nBefore I submit a pull request on ExpressJS to fix this [here](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/master/lib/response.js#L238):\n\n``` JavaScript\nvar cb = callback.replace(/[^\\[\\]\\w$.]/g, '');\n```\n\nwith\n\n``` JavaScript\nvar cb = callback.replace(/[^\\[\\]\\w$.'\"]/g, '');\n```\n\n…is there a reason that quotes are being stripped out - should I instead get esri-leaflet to change the callback they provide? Other services (not written in ExpressJS) do not strip this out.\n\nCheers,\n\nNick.\n",

    "body": "I have three middleware callbacks in a route. I want to bypass middleware callbacks and pass control to  last callback.\n\nA example code\n\n``` javascript\nvar middleware = [loadData, loadForum, loadThread];\n\napp.get('/forum/:fid/thread/:tid', middleware, finalMethod);\n```\n\n**Use case**:  If first callback `loadData` enters into strange case like failing to load data. I would like by pass `loadForum` and `loadThread` middleware callbacks and pass control to last route callback `finalMethod`.\n\nIf  `next()` is called in middleware callback,  it will go to next callback.\nIf I understand correctly, `next('route')` will go to other route given in argument of `next` method, not to last route callback.\n\nHow to bypass middleware callbacks and pass control to last callback?\n\nI am trying to avoid deep nested functions in methods. So I think to set middleware in routes, each nesting functions can be splitted into each method and setting it's result in `request` object. So that next middleware method can be access its result through `request` object.\nIs this good way to handle deep nested functions or any other good way to do this?\n",

If there are 20 warnings and number 21 comes along, it will never get noticed. If there are zero warnings and one show up, it will get noticed.\n\nAnyway, I noticed the following warnings which I can't fix since I can't find any repositories on github:\n\n``` bash\nnpm WARN package.json range-parser@0.0.4 No repository field.\nnpm WARN package.json methods@0.0.1 No repository field.\nnpm WARN package.json methods@0.0.1 No readme data.\nnpm WARN package.json fresh@0.1.0 No repository field.\nnpm WARN package.json send@0.1.0 No repository field.

    "body": "Hi guys! I was using the <audio> tag to play a mp3 file hosted on my express server (the mp3 file was simply placed in my 'public' folder), but node will crash with fatal memory leak.\n\nSuppose the mp3 file is http://mysite/foo.mp3 (~2MB), when I open a HTML with a <audio src='http://mysite/foo.mp3' autoplay> tag, the server-end memory usage will increase up to 100%... But if I directly download the file, everything's OK. After some searching and testing, I found that the <audio> tag is sending multiple ranged requests, node then behaves strange(keeping all requests and data chunks in memory?). It happens on remote servers, while localhost works well.  \n\nIt seems to be a bug in the 'http' module, but maybe express can handle it with some work-around?\n",
