    "body": "This is the default behavior when you access a directory using express.static and do not have a trailing slash and there is an index.html file. This matches the behavior of other servers like Apache. The reason is that without the redirect, there is now two different URLs to access the page in which relative links on the page will behavie differently. If you do not use relative links, then you can turn off the redirect by passing the `redirect: false` option to express.static.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps!",
