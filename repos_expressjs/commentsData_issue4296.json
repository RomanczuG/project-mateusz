If you want to have a point at which you can append new routes above some other routes, use a sub router. For example, create a sub router (`express.Router()`) and `app.use` it before your error handler, at the point you want the plugin to append the routes. Then have the plugin append to that sub router instance instead of top level router (`app`).",

I believe what I provided  did answer your question with the information you provided. If it did not, I'm very sorry. Likely I need more information about what you are trying to do in order to understand your question and help. Generally, the issue tracker is not really the place for question on \"how to do X with Express\", so we try to close them out. You can drop by our Gitter or try Stackoverflow where we and the greater community can help on general how to do X type of questions.",

    "body": "So there are usually two answers for that. The typical desire when folks want to unuse a router is usually because they want to replace it (so maybe this applies to you), in which case the current pattern is to call it via a local reference:\r\n```js\r\nvar router = express.Router()\r\n// ...\r\napp.use((req, res, next) => router(req, res, next))\r\n// ...\r\n// changing the \"router\" variable to a different instance will \"swap it\"\r\n// can also use a property on an object to allow changing from other files\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompletely unusing it at runtime because the idea is that you're going to add it once, then later remove it, never to add it back ever again, is typically rare, but still possible. The typical example is the same as above, but adding a `if`:\r\n```js\r\napp.use((req, res, next) => router ? router(req, res, next) : next())\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, as to your point, folks are welcome, if they really desire it, to add features to the router via a pull request. The router source code for Express it at https://github.com/pillarjs/router . I mention this because you mentioned above a feature request, but history shows us a feature request just never gets done, as those who work on the project work on what they want/need, and so it would already exist if those who already worked on it wanted/needed it, so to make something happen takes a pull request from the outside contributor vs just making a feature request in an issue and waiting years and years :)",
