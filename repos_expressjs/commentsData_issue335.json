    "body": "yeah exactly. it is easy to argue that views _should_ have async support, and in some cases I totally agree, however for rendering html I find the use case for this extremely low. Mu is no faster (infact slower) than haml.js for example. \n\nLogic _should_ be in the \"route\" handler, I dont like the idea of views hitting the database etc. When a practical need for async support exists then I will gladly support it, however at the moment I dont see the need for this. If you are generating a feed or something, its great, but then there is also not really a need to use the view system at all\n",

    "body": "blah lol github didnt post my reply. There is very little (practical) need for async views, I dont want that sort of logic in views, and Mu is no faster (infact slower) than haml.js. There is no reason you cant do async stuff before handing over to the view system, which IMO is the way it should be. If / when practical use cases appear I will happily support async template engines.\n\nWe have already been discussing this in IRC, and many of us agree that flushing the document HEAD early should be obtainable, but all of these async partial hacks etc are completely unnecessary \n",
