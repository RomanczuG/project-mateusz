    "body": "Thanks for sharing your idea :) I put the \"Ideas\" label on it.\n\nSo for some history, the reason right now express does not call middlewares with a context (the `this`) is because it's most expensive than just calling the function (in which you get the global context or `null` depending on if your code is in strict mode) and there hasn't been a very compelling reason to add it (not saying we wouldn't if there was a really awesome use-case).\n\nA good example of making use of the context can be seen in the `koa` web framework: https://github.com/koajs/koa\n",

    "body": "thank you :)\nyes, this idea is inspired from koa.\n\nIn my case, I hope to add app because I want to share the same view between server and client.\nIn server, I can simply render a view, however, in client, i need to send the view file for client to render under the same route. In that case, I need to get the view directory from `req.app.get('views')`. Inspired from koa, it makes me thinking why not `this.get('views')` ? I know it is not a compelling reason, Just for your reference, thank you :)\n",
