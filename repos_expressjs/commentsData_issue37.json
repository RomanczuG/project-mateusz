    "body": "TJ, I'm just getting to know Express so I suspect I'm just missing something here, I'm just bringing to the table my understanding of how I'd expect a web app framework to work — to me, sure, HEAD is generally the same as GET (except you don't send the body of course) — but sometimes when implementing an app you do want to programmatically handle HEAD differently than GET. For example if you have a more efficient way to generate the headers than generating the entire response body — which, granted, is rare.\n\nAnyway, I'm also not sure what you mean about hacking core node to support HEAD natively. I would think it'd just work out of the box, and indeed I've coded up a quick example that seems to work correctly:\n\n``` javascript\nrequire('http').createServer(function(req, res) {\n    var body = 'hello world';\n\n    var headers = {'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Content-Length': body.length};\n\n    if (req.method !== 'HEAD' && req.method !== 'OPTIONS') {\n        res.writeHead(200, headers);\n        res.write(body);\n    } else {\n        res.writeHead(204, headers);\n    }\n\n    res.end();\n}).listen(1337, \"127.0.0.1\");\n```\n\n```\n$ curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:1337/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Length: 11\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nhello world\n```\n\n```\n$ curl -i -X HEAD http://127.0.0.1:1337/\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Length: 11\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\n```\n\nI did notice that sending a 200 in response to `HEAD` caused the connection to stay open, I guess curl saw the `Connection: keep-alive` header and was waiting for the response body. Seems like a bug in curl, it should know that no body is coming back in response to HEAD. Anyway, that problem can be fixed/bypassed by either sending 204 or `Connection: close` — I tested both.\n",
