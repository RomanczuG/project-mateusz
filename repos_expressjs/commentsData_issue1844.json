Although it starts to be inconsistent with qs module used by connect. Ouch.\n\n/me asks @visionmedia about whether difference between qs module and built-in querystring module is intentional or not.\n\nWe're bikeshedding, aren't we?\n",

On issue #1734 and PR #1735, I argued that the server _should_ respond with a 400 Bad Request.\n\n> The percent symbol should denote a percent-encoded octet, and o is not a valid hexadecimal digit. You can expect a request to `/%25doesntwork.html` to respond with `/%doesntwork.html`, however, as `%25` is the percent-encoded version of `%`, a request with the path `/%doesntwork.html` should fail. See [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986), sections 2.1 and 2.4 for more information.\n> \n> the fact that express now ignores malformed urls is both counter-intuitive and a potential security threat\n\nI am absolutely in favor of strict parsing, or at the very least making that configurable (which would probably take a performance hit).\n",

But you might want to use spaces in there instead of underlines, so what about `http://localhost:300/%my%20malformed%20uri` ?\n\n> I can deal with it on my own however I please.\n\nSure, I just checked it, and `app.use(function(req, res){ res.send(req.url) })` works fine with malformed uris. But if you use router, it should parse string to find out where you should route to.\n\nPS: you can deal with it anyway, `app.use(function(err, req, res, next){})` should interrupt such cases.\n",
