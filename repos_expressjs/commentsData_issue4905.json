    "body": "Hello, and sorry to hear that. Throwing on invalid method / function arguments is the standard API in Node.js . You will find usage of any Node.js core API to do the same. We keep our API styles consistent with core.\r\n\r\nYou can test this with `res.setHeader('\\n')`, which will throw and is not an Express.js API, but rather part of Node.js: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/http.html#responsesetheadername-value\r\n\r\n> The documentation should emphasise that maxAge expects a natural with a maximum limit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am sorry the documentation has failed you. Our documentation is largely community-contributed and I would encourage you to help improve the docs with the wording you are looking for.",

    "body": "Sorry, I got caught up in what seemed the main point: it should not throw. This is not something that will be changed for the above reason (unless Node.js starts changing their own APIs to no longer throw on argument validation). But there is a valid subpoint to your issue: the error message is wrong and should be regarding maxAge, not expires.",
