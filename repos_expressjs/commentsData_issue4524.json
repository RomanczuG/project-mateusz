    "body": "The behaviour you are describing is in line with the documentation. The route `/resource/:id` matches `/resources/subresource` simply because it's being \"hit\" earlier in the stack than the route with that exact path definition.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible to rearrange the route position, then a regular expression is the way to go. I haven't tested it, but this should most likely work, if :id represents a number:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /resource/:id(\\\\d+^)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise you might want to find out which regular expression matches the id.",
