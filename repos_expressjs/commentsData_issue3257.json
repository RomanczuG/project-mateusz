    "body": "Thanks for the stack trace, @nstuyvesant . The hard part is that Express itself does not make use of Promises, and the only parts of Express in your stack are just the boundaries where Express calls your user-land code, so without understanding what the user-land code is, it's hard to say. I'm also not sure if ultimately it is anything Express could fix at all; it may just perhaps be an issue in the user-land code that just needs to be resolved, but since Express calls your code, it of course shows up in the stack traces :)",

    "body": "Hey @nstuyvesant, if I could just interject briefly as I use bluebird as well and rely on this warning to catch some careless mistakes. \r\n\r\nFirstly this is a description of this specific warning, what causes it (in general), and a few workarounds: http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/warning-explanations.html#warning-a-promise-was-created-in-a-handler-but-was-not-returned-from-it\r\n\r\nNormally, one would always want to be returning their promises as to not accidentally be swallowing errors or returns (although there are use cases not to, ofc). One awkward case when dealing with Express 4 is within a route context, as you want to start your chain with Promise.try() but at the same time you can't _return_ this promise chain from the route (as it's a callback). This is usually the situation where you'll see this warning using express and what I suspect is happening here.\r\n\r\nOne \"solution\" is to use [`express-promise-router`](https://github.com/express-promise-router/express-promise-router), which affords you the ability to return a promise from your router (by extending the core express router) which should shut up this warning. Also you get the benefit of (what is more or less) `next(err)` if an error is thrown from your returned chain.\r\n\r\nFinally, you're going to want to return whatever the ultimate response path is of this chain (whether a res.render, next call, or similar) to keep this warning suppressed. Alternatively, you can use `return null` like in the post i linked to above. Cheers.",

    "body": "@jkantr  Thanks, very helpful.\r\nAnother approach is to wrap the handler with a `Router`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = (req, res, next) => {\r\n    expand(req).then(user => {\r\n            req.user = user;\r\n            // the next handler is a promise\r\n            next();\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(next);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = (() => {\r\n    const router = Router();\r\n    router.use((req, res, next) => {\r\n        expand(req).then(user => {\r\n                req.user = user;\r\n                // the next handler is a promise\r\n                next();\r\n            })\r\n            .catch(next);\r\n    });\r\n    return router;\r\n})();\r\n```",
