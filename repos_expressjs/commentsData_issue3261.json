    "body": "Hi @swapnilaryan you should defiantly be using a module like `cors()` instead of trying to piece together the headers and logic yourself. That being said, there is a lot that goes on for CORS. There is no known issue with cors not working with Express 4, so I would first try to use the support forum https://gitter.im/expressjs/express to work through your issue until you have a reason to believe there is a bug to fix somewhere and can articulate the bug.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps! Lots of users are around of the support forum to help, but unfortunately this is not really a support forum.",
