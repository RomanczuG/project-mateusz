With a `next()` call in your middleware function, it works as it should both locally and remotely; without it, it doesn't function properly either locally or remotely. Could you try to come up with a different example that reproduces your issue?\n",

If it wasn't then this wouldn't have worked when i tested the request in the browser. Also the site wouldn't have worked at all. I also checked before i posted the issue to make sure the next was being called.\n\nBut whatever the case may be, i did something and it works now... So I'm just going to assume i did some stupid mistake and forget about this.\n",
