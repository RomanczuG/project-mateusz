    "body": "While I understand the philosophical reasoning for removing it (express does one thing well, middleware should be independent), I believe serve-static should stay bundled, both as a convenience and to facilitate ease of learning.\n\n\"So, express is the microframework everyone uses to make rich node applications. If you want to serve your css, you can do\n\n``` js\napp.use('/public/app.css', function(req, res, next) { res.sendFile(__dirname + '/public/app.css' ) })\n```\n\n\"\n\nIs a bit nuts, imho. If every tutorial started with `npm install express serve-static` just to get started, it would be a good introduction to the philosophy, but also add unnecessary mental overhead.\n\nFor better or worse, Express is The Standard now.\n",

    "body": "Hi! To add context on why the documentation is not a link, it is because that results in poor user experience. For example, it is frustrating if Github is down, but expressjs.com is up and you cannot reach the static docs. Another reason I that the module can easily have features not yet included in Express, because Express is using an older version. If you think that there are issues or improvements to be made in the express site, please feel free to make a pull request to the site (https://github.com/strongloop/expressjs.com).\n\nThe code has not been in express for a long time, but that doesn't make this discussion irrelevant. The issue with even having the dependency means there can be little innovation in the static module because it must continue to maintain backwards compatibility for Express, and I am pretty much the only resource for the express mainline, and do not have bandwidth to maintain multiple lineages of the static module and all it's dependencies, in addition to the multiple lineages of Express and many other modules.\n\nHaving static a dependency of Express has pretty much stagnated that module for years, and will for as long as Express 4 is maintained (probably another year+). If we drop it from express 5, we can stop that cycle.\n",
