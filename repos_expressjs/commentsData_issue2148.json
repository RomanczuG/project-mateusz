    "body": "@aredridel ah, I see from your public activity this was from trying to use `shot`. That gives me a good base line to play with. If you find time, this is what I'm thinking of having Express 5 do with the prototypes: instead of replacing the prototype of the incoming `req` and `res` (which really only works when it comes from the Node.js core HTTP server), I want to basically \"inject\" our prototype into the prototype chain of the incoming `req` and `res` such that it's the first link, but it continues with the previous chain.\n\nThis also means we can remove that prototype mount stuff, since we'd now have a generic solution for sub apps' proto chains (and it would work better when mounting an app as a sub app of multiple parents).\n",
