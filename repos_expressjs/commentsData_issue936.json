    "body": "I think removing it would be better. If you just undocument it, people that have it in their codebase won't remove it (why would they if it works) and then it will just break when you actually do remove it. Since updating code to not use it is backwards compatible with the 2.x line I think removing it would be fine. If you think about how a typical deployment could play out, a developer can easily update the code for 3.x (remove configure) and still be working fine on 2.x. To me, that means it should be pretty safe to remove.\n",

As for the pros of removing it:\n\n• less misleading since people often think it's required\nI feel like if this is a problem than it's a documentation issue.\n\n•  middleware config in separate function calls is difficult to manage\nThis indicates a problem with the organization of our application.\n\n• it's unclear that the functions are executed immediately\nThis seems valid, maybe the function implies it will be \"configured\" and then applied when the application is run. I think this is something you learn once and you won't have any problems with in the future.\n\nI think `app.configure()` is a pretty elegant solution to adding middleware and setting up your application.\n",

    "body": "+1 for removing generator and just leaving the examples. Express is meant to be easy to get started with by hand without a generator :)\n\nI thought about the app.configure() stuff and have come to the following conclusion; remove it in 4.0 no deprecation warning now. Many people will simply not see the warning since they may not track 3.x upgrades all the time and we can better document it on a 3.x -> 4.x migration wiki.\n",

    "body": "Interesting.\n\nThe app structure generated by most generators can be justified depending\non their requirements, but it is important to let developers (esp.\nbeginners) know that architecting an app is distinct from Express, the\nframework. They can either have a one-page app, or more complex setups like\n- Ghost, Sails, Kraken, etc.\n\nIt might be a good idea to keep the built-in generator; if anything, make\nit simpler, if possible. Yeoman / Grunt should not become a dependency.\nLet's keep Express self-contained and very beginner-friendly.\n\nOn Wed, Nov 20, 2013 at 11:18 AM, Jonathan Ong notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> here's a crazy generator i just ran across on reddit:\n> https://github.com/paypal/kraken-js but it's super opinionated and it's\n> made my paypal, so...\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/visionmedia/express/issues/936#issuecomment-28865356\n> .\n",
