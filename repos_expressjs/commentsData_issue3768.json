    "body": "You always have to handle \"bad routes\".  In the case above, all you really want do to do is call next without an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.get('/:id (req, res, next) => {\r\n  const resource = db.getResourceById(req.params.id)\r\n  if (!resource) {\r\n    return next()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // do thing with resource then return it\r\n  res.json(resource)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would result in the next set of middleware being called, and if none other matched you would want a default 404 handler at the end of your application middleware stack:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp.use((req, res) => {\r\n  res.status(404).json({\r\n    someBody: 'Route not found or missing resource.....'\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a very common express pattern, if you have any questions it might be a good idea to reference the docs on the website.  Good luck!\r\n\r\nThe last bit of code there should be in all of your express apps, because typically you don't want the default express behavior because you want to return a custom 404 response telling the consumer what happened and why it was a 404.",
