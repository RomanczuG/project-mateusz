It's basically impossible to look \"up\" the stack, because of the extreme flexibility here (and the fact that you can have a single router mounted in multiple places). Instead, the `params` option can simply take an object of defined params, which you can pass in. Something like `new Router({ params: app.params })`, perhaps. This is still in flux, because it does not have an easy solution with the current structure.\n\nJust wanted to give an update here.\n",

    "body": "@dougwilson Regarding registered param middleware, I am mostly confused I think by your side note about the difficulty of multiple mountings of a single router--can you explain that a little bit more?  Does that impact param middleware working (#2 below) or the presence of req.params from the \"parent\" route (#1)?\n\n``` javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.param('user', function (req, res, next, id) {\n  req.user = { id: id, name: 'Fred' };\n  next();\n});\n\napp.use('/foo/:user', express.Router({ params: 'inherit' })\n    .get(function (req, res) {\n        console.log(req.params.user); // #1\n        console.log(req.user); // #2\n    }));\n```\n\nIf I had to choose, getting child params working is much more important than sharing param middleware--the latter can be worked around while it's impossible to get around the former.  The idea of passing in the params from one router to the other would be pretty handy for getting the param middleware on the child, but does not address accessing req.params from the parent route, correct?\n\nMaybe these need to be tracked by separate issues?\n",

    "body": "> Maybe these need to be tracked by separate issues?\n\n@adamterlson I'm not sure what you're talking about, sorry. If you like, you can send an email to my email in my GitHub profile and we can have a voice conversation so I can figure out what you are talking about.\n\n>  Does that impact param middleware working (# 2 below) or the presence of req.params from the \"parent\" route (# 1)?\n\nnum 1 already works and is not changing. # 2 is what this is about, but your example does populate # 2, because it doesn't use child params, so I'm still confused about what you are talking about, since your example currently works in the existing express (and thus would not be changing).\n\nThe router does not know what it's parent is, so there is no easy way to get the params from the \"parent\". Think of this case:\n\n``` js\nvar app = express()\nvar app2 = express()\nvar router = express.Router()\n\napp.param('user', function () { /* get user from redis */ })\napp2.param('user', function () { /* get user from mysql */ })\n\napp.use('/something', router)\napp2.use('/api', router)\n```\n\nRouter has, in effect, 2 parents with different params, etc. The solution to how router determines what \"user\" param function to use is not easy, since it cannot be determined at construction time and there is no current mechanism to bring this data to the router, especially such that it works with multiple levels of routers.\n",

    "body": "Ah, I'm definitely to blame as reused my previous example.  Here's a more accurate one that I think is more illustrative as it uses two params, one at the \"higher\" level and one in the use'd router.\n\n``` javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.param('foo', function (req, res, next, id) {\n  req.foo = 'Foo';\n  next();\n});\n\napp.param('bar', function (req, res, next, id) {\n  req.bar = 'Bar';\n  next();\n});\n\napp.use('/:foo', express.Router()\n    .get('/:bar', function (req, res) {\n        console.log(req.params.foo); // #1 - Undefined -- Cannot be worked around in any way I'm aware of\n        console.log(req.params.bar); // #2 - Works\n        console.log(req.foo); // #3 - Works\n        console.log(req.bar); // #4 - Undefined -- Can be worked around by re-registering all params on router\n    }));\n```\n\nI would love for # 1 - 4 to all work (via some opt-in config option or whatever), and # 1 I consider to be the most important.\n\nYour proposal would make # 4 work, but would not address # 1.\n",
