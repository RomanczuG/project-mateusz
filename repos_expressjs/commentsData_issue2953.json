    "body": "OK, I noticed that send `1.x` release proposal branch is already using `mime-types`, but it doesn't seem to expose it in its `exports`. This is why I assumed that we were moving to a direct require.\n\nSince that isn't the case, is the plan to release send `1.x` and then move Express 5.0 up to that version (it's currently pointing at `0.13.1`)? Do we just need to update send `1.x` to export mime?\n\n**EDIT**: Fixed typo in first line.\n",
