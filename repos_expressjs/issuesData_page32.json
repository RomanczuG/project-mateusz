    "body": "I can't see any of my `res.locals` from hjs templates. I first noticed this while trying to use connect-cachify, which I gave up on, thinking it was broken. I've since realised that the problem is actually in express: \n\nDebugging `res.locals()` immediately prior to calling `res.render` shows that my locals are set as expected. I can force the values into my template by merging them explicitly with `options`, but this is annoying. I forked and debugged in express application.js and response.js and I believe I have found the problem - line 789 of response.js:\n\n```\noptions._locals = self.locals;\n```\n\n`self.locals` is a function, so this doesn't actually expose the values to the template. I changed the line to read:\n\n```\noptions._locals = self.locals();\n```\n\n...and now my templates see the values correctly and everything in my app works. \n\nHowever, I ran the express tests and they fail in res.render.js because they set up the text fixture with `locals` as an object, not a function, which makes me doubt my fix (I am very new to node and express). Am I on the right track, or way off?  \n",

But when I try this: `curl http://localhost:1234/url/http://www.example.com/something`, I get this:\n\n```\n['http://www.example.com/url/http://www.example.com/url/http://www.example.com/url/http://www.example.com/url/http://www.example.com/something' ]\n```\n\n... it is really wrong. This crazy stuff happens only when the param URL starts with _http://_ and contains a least one more slash.\n\nYou can argue that I should escape param URL and you are right that works fine: `curl http://localhost:1234/url/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fsomething`\n\n... but this is not user friendly and I've seen applications using this pattern (not using Express) and e.g. Restify (http://mcavage.me/node-restify) handle this correctly.\n",

    "body": "Hi guys! One pain when using express is that its `dev` log doesn't print the `date` of requests. When you trace back the log file to find/debug something, it is really hard to analyze and estimate the problem without dates. Can you imagine a log without time dimension? It would lose much of its power.\n\nOf course I can custom the logger format with everything I want, while with some efforts of google and reading into codes of express and connect. I know express just exposes the logger property of connect, but that is not an excuse. Logging request with time is everyone wants and it should be default.\n\nIf you agree with me, I can contribute on this. \n",

    "body": "Hi guys! I was a huge fan of `req.param`, used it all the time and didn't care much. Well, until I suddenly realized that it doesn't always return strings (as documentation states), but it can also return arrays, if query or body parsers caught the same parameter twice.\n\nThis renders most code like `req.param('email', '').trim().toLowerCase()` broken, and checking _each and every_ parameter with `Array.isArray` is pretty much an overkill.\n\nI'd suggest that the default behavior of `req.param` would be like this:\n\n```\nreq.param = function(name, defaultValue){\n  var params = this.params || {};\n  var body = this.body || {};\n  var query = this.query || {};\n  var value = (params.hasOwnProperty(name) && params[name]) ||\n    body[name] || query[name];\n  return Array.isArray(value) ? value[0] : (value || defaultValue);\n};\n```\n\nAnd also adding a method like that:\n\n```\nreq.list = function(name){\n  var params = this.params || {};\n  var body = this.body || {};\n  var query = this.query || {};\n  var value = (params.hasOwnProperty(name) && params[name]) ||\n    body[name] || query[name];\n  if (null == value) return [];\n  return Array.isArray(value) ? value : [value];\n};\n```\n\nYou see, the second one always returns arrays, even if parameter isn't provided at all, which is totally ok if you expect the N-arity input.\n\nI'm not sure about the `req.list` name, though. Also not sure whether this breaking change should be done the hard way — by reimplementing the `req.param` — or by introducing the third method and leaving `req.param` as is.\n",

I could be wrong but I believe this means it should always have the scheme and domain, never just the path.\n\nWhen I use `res.location('/page2')` I'm getting exactly that back in the location value, but I wonder if Express should send out the full URL?\n\nObviously most (all?) browsers don't mind either way, but I wanted to flag it, since it seems a good idea to follow the spec as closely as possible.\n",

    "body": "I've been writing some apps in express that can/are being used both as mounted applications and standalone servers. While trying to figure out the structure of this application I came across [`app.emit('mount')`](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/82a7d7a9778a6047b2ec53fba9fd086a47e93c5a/lib/application.js#L131), which solves the problem elegantly. I would love to see some stronger documentation about this event, is there a reason it hasn't been documented?\n\nMy solution, FWIW:\n\n``` javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = module.exports = express();\n\nfunction init() {\n  // ... configure app, or whatever\n}\n\napp._listen = app.listen;\napp.listen = function () {\n  init();\n  app.removeListener('mount', init);\n  app._listen.apply(app, arguments);\n}\n\napp.once('mount', function () {\n  init();\n  app.listen = app._listen;\n})\n```\n",

If (as I do) the auth methods returns \"true\" when auth is successful, the 2nd \"user\" var will have \"true\" as a value, and not the user name. Thus req.remoteUser will also be \"true\".\nIn the sync case, we test callback(user,pass) and if it's true we set remoteUser to the original \"user\". We don't do stuff like\n\n```\nuser = callback(user, pass);\nreq.remoteUser = user;\n```\n\nWhich is the equivalent of what we do in the async case.\nSo I would suggest to just change the code to :\n\n```\n// async\n    if (callback.length >= 3) {\n      var pause = utils.pause(req);\n      callback(user, pass, function(err, authOk){\n        if (err || !authOk)  return unauthorized(res, realm);\n        req.user = req.remoteUser = user;\n        next();\n        pause.resume();\n      });\n    // sync\n    } else {\n      if (callback(user, pass)) {\n        req.user = req.remoteUser = user;\n        next();\n      } else {\n        unauthorized(res, realm);\n      }\n    }\n```\n",

The problem is the content-length on that action in question is less then 1024 and the ETag isn't generated.\n\nAnd I also couldn't find any unit test covering this specific condition len > 1024 on the source-code so I imagine that it's not THAT significant, right?\n",

I am struggling understanding if this behaviour is wanted.\n\nIt appears to me that this is the part of connect that is responsible for this: https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/lib/proto.js#L124-L158\n\nThere are possibly two problems here; (a) if there is another item in the stack, we should always pass the control to that handler, and not stop there and (b) if headers have been sent, we should never attempt to set a new header (in this case the content type).\n\nAm I wrong?\n\nChris\n",

Files are sent to the noxmox library as if it's S3, so their \"put\" instruction is on an arbitrarily deep URL, but noxmox will store the blob on disk as just `bucketname/fileWithSlashesEscaped`, so in order to resolve URL requests, mox-server needs to grab a tail for a URL so that it can do the uri-encode step on the string with slashes and then fetch the file from disk based on that.\n",

    "body": "Suppose ./routes/index.js defines an object \n\n``` javascript\nfoobar = { foo: \"a\", bar: [1, 2]};\n```\n\nThen suppose we have two routes:\n\n``` javascript\nexports.one = function(req,res){\n  // All four outputs (2 to console, two rendered as HTML) should give the full 'foobar' object.\n  // And this is exactly what we get.\n  res.locals.foobar = foobar;\n  console.log('Route says, foobar is ' + JSON.stringify(res.locals.foobar));\n  res.locals.raboof = foobar;\n  console.log('Route says, raboof is ' + JSON.stringify(res.locals.raboof));\n  res.render('view');\n};\n\nexports.two = function(req,res){\n  // All four outputs (2 to console, two rendered as HTML) should give the 'foo' member.\n  // The console outputs are as expected.  One HTML rendering matches; the other is inconsistent.\n  // The inconsistent one is the one which uses the same name (foobar) in both scopes. \n  res.locals.foobar = foobar.foo;   // same name in both scopes -> behaves unexpectedly\n  console.log('Route says, foobar is ' + JSON.stringify(res.locals.foobar));\n  res.locals.raboof = foobar.foo;   // different names -> behaves as expected\n  console.log('Route says, raboof is ' + JSON.stringify(res.locals.raboof));\n  res.render('view');\n};\n```\n\nWe see that node knows very well what we intended, as confirmed by the console outputs for both routes.  And when jade renders the view for route 'one' we see the expected output -- the full 'foobar' object.  But when jade renders the view for route 'two' we get a surprise (at least I did).  Although the console output clearly shows that we expect just the foo component of foobar, the rendered view matches the console (as intended) only if we do _not_ reuse the module-scoped name 'foobar' in the function's res.locals.\\* scope.  If we _do_ reuse the name, we get a surprise when the rendered HTML gives the full foobar object from the module scope, regardless of the value assigned via res.locals.foobar = whatever.\n\nI suspect this has something to do with res.locals having become a function in express 3.x but I have to say that this is _extremely_ surprising behavior and can easily lead to some very hard to find bugs.  This got me in a real application and I wasted an embarrassing amount of time in disbelief before building a test app.  Even if this behavior can be rationalized, is it really a good thing?  \n",
