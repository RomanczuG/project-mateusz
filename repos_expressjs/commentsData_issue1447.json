    "body": "You're kidding me? This would be very useful to have. What's the point of even supporting inline regular expressions half-assed like this? I've already written the code that fixes this issue and enables routes to have the the power of regular expressions and the convenience of keys. Just look at my pull request for page.js (https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js/pull/42).\n\nI'll give you some examples where regular expressions in paths would be useful:\n\nWhen you have keys that must be a number:\n\n```\n/path/:key([0-9]+)\n```\n\nThis path wouldn't work if you brought back + support in path strings. However, you still have \\* support, and I doubt you wont want to be dropping support for this anytime soon. And, having support for \\* makes the following path string faulty:\n\n```\n/path/:key(goo*gle)\n```\n\nThis will allow you to handle routes such as /path/google and /path/gooooooogle which maybe come in useful...maybe not. But the point is that supporting \\* in regular expressions is critical; if you don't, you'll cause Express developers pain when the suddenly have broken code when you promise inline regular expressions yet don't deliver it.\n\nPlease reconsider.\n",
