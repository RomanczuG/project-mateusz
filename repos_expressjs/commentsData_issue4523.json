    "body": "@mkastner  This is a good idea, So we will display the `domain`, `method`, `URI` and `middleware`  for the routes it includes in the generated table. The most significant implementation is to add function like `debugRoutes` It will return the output as follows.\r\n```\r\n| Domain   |      URI      |  Method |  Middleware |\r\n|-------- -|:-------------:|--------:| -----------:|\r\n|          |  /api         |   GET   | YES         |\r\n```",

    "body": "@getspooky Thanks for your postive response to my _musings_ on the router.\r\n\r\nYet, I was more leaning toward the idea of the router events being fired only once, when the application starts up. I.e. when the routes are being \"mounted\".\r\n\r\nLike in my example here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mkastner/mk-express-router-doc/blob/main/test/index.js\r\n\r\nIf you want the domain, you would have to have an actual request to take place. But then you could simply us a request logger. But that wasn't the concern I was focusing on.\r\n\r\nWhat I had in mind was something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst rootRouter = request('express').router();\r\nconst childRouter = request('express').router();\r\n\r\n// fires e.g. 'method' event -> {route: '/', method: 'get', handler: ['anonymous'|functionName]); \r\nrouter.get('/', someHandler);\r\nrouter.use('/admin', childRouter);\r\n// fires e.g. 'middleware' event -> { parentRoute: '/', route: '/admin', method: '*', handler: ['anonymous',functionName]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like the events explain the structure of routes:\r\n\r\n- Which route(r) is parent?\r\n  Since each router knows its parent, it's possible to \"walk\" up the hierarchy to root.\r\n- What routes are mounted to each router?\r\n- What's their purpose? Is it a\r\n  - request handler?\r\n  - middleware?\r\n  - router?\r\n- What's the handler implementation:\r\n  - anonymous function\r\n  - named function\r\n\r\nBasically, what I am hoping for is an evented router creation which enables the api programmer to generate a living routing documentation based on the fired informations.\r\n",
