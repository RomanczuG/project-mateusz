    "body": "How would you use JSONP with POST requests? With JSONP, you inject a `<script>` tag to the page, which can't be used to send POST requests. You can only read the response of POST requests under the same-origin policy rules (same host, port and protocol), in which case you can just use ajax and regular JSON response, instead of JSONP.\n",
