    "body": "Hey Guys,\n\nFor an upcoming app I'm wanting to have the views in any of the following markup languages: markdown, textile, haml, html, whatever. Then after that run them through a template engine like: eco or ejs\n\nThough I'm not really sure how to go about this. I'd imagine in the end being able to do something like `something.md.eco`, `something.md` and just `something` with the missing parts as system defaults would be nice. Another requirement I gather would be specifying the order of the template engines, for instance you would want eco to run first, then the markdown parser.\n\nThe markdown example is nice, but I do require markdown files (or textile, whatever) to be parsed through a template engine rather than just variable interpolation.\n",

    "body": "I have an app which is using connect.vhost to redirect to a few express servers and after updating express I noticed an issue with view being read from the wrong server.\n\nMy setup is something like this:\n\nvhosts.js \na/server.js\na/views/index.js\na/views/athing.js\nb/server.js\nb/views/index.js\nb/views/bthing.js\n\nWhere vhosts.js is a simple connect server, running through cluster with these vhosts:\n- a.example.com -> a/server.js\n- b.example.com -> b/server.js\n\nI guess the problem is that both servers have a view like \"./views/index.js\". It seems it attempts to render the view of the server that was visited first, no matter which one of the servers you visit, which causes a crash because both servers don't use the same locals and well, it's just the wrong view being rendered.\n\nCould it be that the cache is not using an absolute path for the views? And it used to before 2.2.1?\n",

If i were to create a delete file after download routine, I need a download detection system which can differentiate the users action, if they were to cancel, lost connection, or finished download.\n\nI wanted my delete file after download routine to just delete the file if the users fully finished downloading the file and not if their connection is lost or canceled or any other else.\n",

    "body": "I created an empty express app with `express -t haml -c sass` and added a simple index.haml file. On rendering I get a an error on `express/2.1.0/package/lib/view.js` line 343 that there's no method `call` on template.\n\nI used node-inspect to have a look at that piece of code and found that when using jade `template` is a function (which of course has `call`) and when using haml `template` is a string.\n\nI'm very new to JS and am at the end of the line. I'd like to use haml for my project since Im familiar with it, but I also could work with jdae. But I think if there's a bug it should be fixed :)\n\nVersions:\nexpress -v 2.1.0\nnpm -v 0.2.11-5\nnode -v v0.4.2\nhaml@0.2.5 \nhamljs@0.5.1  (not sure if this is used at all...)\n\nThanks! :)\n",

One is that module.parent.exports seems to be populated only for the first require() child; the second gets undefined for the module.parent.exports.app.  \n\nAnother issue however is that the middleware linkage for .use seems to be more fragile.  This also doesn't work (/static pages don't load correctly):\n\n<h3>[app.js]</h3>\n\n<pre>var express = exports.express = require('express');\nvar app = exports.app = express.createServer();\nvar config = require('./config')(app, express);</pre>\n\n<h3>[config.js]</h3>\n\n<pre>var app_config = module.exports = function(app, express) {\n  app.configure(function(){\n    app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/static'));\n  }\n}</pre>\n\n\nBasically, I'd like to have a ruby-like app organization, with virtual servers via createServer in one top-level app.js file, and separate app_config.js and app_routes.js for each vhost app.  express seems to be very particular with the syntax for this, and fail in strange ways, with middleware pieces changing behavior or not activating properly.  Also, it seems node.js in general doesn't have an elegant, reliable construct for passing parent exports to the child modules.\n\nThe express framework looks really awesome, I'd just like to know it can handle larger site organizations flexibly.

Add support for the old syntax in static() for backwards compliance\n3. Add a check in static() that fails when someone tries to pass an options hash as the \"root\" parameter.\n\nIf you want, you can reply with your preference and I can create a new pull request with it.\n",

Check out a js implementation [here](http://jsfiddle.net/seanmonstar/WfWhN/) from [seanmonster](http://seanmonstar.com/post/3746460491/function-kwargs) as an example (maybe not a great one, not sure myself).\n\nThis is a relatively audacious request so I'm thinking it'll only happen if you fancy kwargs yourself.

    "body": "I think this issue is actually in node itself, but I thought I would post it here.\n\nWhen running an https server with express, I noticed that when I lit up a logger and tried to print the remoteAddress, it was returning undefined. After some investigation, I found that the socket object in the request was missing the remoteAddress property. I also found that req.socket had a socket property as well.\n\nTo work around this for logging purposes, I just added my own little middleware function:\n\n```\nfunction(req,res, next){\n    if( req.socket.socket ){\n        req.socket.remoteAddress = req.socket.socket.remoteAddress;\n    }\n    next();\n};\n```\n\nHowever, I think this indicates a larger problem that may affect other code expecting certain missing properties from the req.socket object.\n\nShould there be consistency between the servers created with http and https?\n",

This patch just restores that ability for 1.0.7. I don't know if this is not in keeping with your plans for people to migrate to 2.x, but it seems to be causing problems for people... not being able to use 1.x in their 0.4.x where they were able to before.\n\nI also don't know what you'd release this as...

How to catch all 6?\n\n```\nresponse.download ('filepath', function(error, path, stream) {\n    if (!error){\n        console.log('request catched'); // will be 6 times\n        stream.on ('end', function(){\n            console.log('end catched'); // will be 4 times\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWell, basically it depends on how many connections. The accelerator I was using uses 4 connection and including getting the content-length 2 time.\n\nThe accelerator is jDownloader (6 catched, 1 = check online, 1 = check content-length, 4 = download connections).\n\nI can't detect the real finished download if this is happening. Any other way? perhaps other way I can use to detect finished downloads?\n",
