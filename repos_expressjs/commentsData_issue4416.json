    "body": "If `FRONTEND_URL` is not under `http://localhost:3000`, then it is not possible to set a cookie from your redirect response that will be visible at `FRONTEND_URL`. This is because web browsers will only allow a cookie to be set on the same domain as the request was on. Your cookie is very likely being set, but since you then redirect to a different domain, that cookie set on `http://localhost:3000` is not going to be accessible / visible, since it is a different domain.",

    "body": "Hi @SeanDez there are several methods, and of course all of which are not specific to Node.js / Express.js and apply to all web technologies as a general web platform question. Due that that, this is outside the scope of the Express.js issue tracker. If you would like to ask the question, a really good place for that exact type of question is https://stackoverflow.com/\r\n\r\nThe main two methods I'm aware of (but of course not the only) are to either include that data in the query string of the destination or to construct a HTML form and use JavaScript to self-submit it to the destination.",
