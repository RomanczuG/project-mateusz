    "body": "@visionmedia, this looks like this wouldn't support the content-type headers in the request and would force request formats to be used. Do you know if the request format would magically get set based on the content-type requested? \n\nAlso, browsers can request multiple content-types and it seems that it would be simpler to handle that using the #content function rather than the case-statement because the logic for finding the best content-type callback given the request would be encapsulated within the Request. I don't think rmontgomery's patch includes this, but it his solution seems to allow for this more cleanly.\n\nOn a personal preference note, I like the visual separation and logical grouping of code using the #content version with a function callback opposed to using a switch statement, but your preference may be different then mine, so I realize it's not a great argument to make.\n\nWDYT?\n",
