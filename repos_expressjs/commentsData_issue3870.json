    "body": "Hi! Thanks for your contribution. I'm a little confused on what exactly changing the cache key does. The contents that are saved in express under the cache do not contain the options you pass into render, and are purely based on the filename, which is why the key is on the file name.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would help me understand if you can show (either a demo app here or through additional tests), in what case would result in the same file have two different data sets saved in the express view cache?",
