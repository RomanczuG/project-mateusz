Ideally just provide everything I need to type on my cmd.exe from clone to seeing the error happening would be best to get the quickest resolution. Also if it's possible to remove as much non-Express modules from the code as possible to narrow down it's actually an Express issue, otherwise it will likely take much longer for us to diagnose. \r\n\r\nIt would be better if you can provide a method of anyone here to reproduce, as if you limit it to just me, I really won't be able to take a look until next week at the earliest after I expect to get discharged from hospital.

Let me write up a quick app that has just this route, as this is the one that I'm having trouble with, and can't figure it out.\r\n\r\nI'll have to keep passport out of the equation, but since I'm using Mongoose (which is just an ORM for MongoDB), and the route specifically uses Mongoose code to provide a response, I'll be connecting to my database with mongoose. I'll also have the new testing repo heavily documented.\r\n\r\nThis will take some time to build up. (maybe an hour or two-ish)\r\n\r\nThanks again! and I hope you don't look at this new repo until you're out of the hospital and feeling much better. I don't want you to endanger your health for this.
