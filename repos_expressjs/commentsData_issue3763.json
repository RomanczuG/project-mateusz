    "body": "Thanks for the report! So there is a lot going on there, but mainly I'm confused as to what you're saying the issue is with express. You showed above that all the cookies are in the response. That's all express does when you use res.cookie: it puts the cookies in the response headers, which you show above.\r\n\r\nCan you describe the issue, exactly? Also, with so much going on, it's hard to know where is exactly an issue is if there is one. For example does the issue happen when you remove serverless thing? Or when you run the express app locally?",

    "body": "So this actually isn’t an issue with Express, but however you wrap Express. It’s caused by the fact that Lambda doesn’t support multiple headers of the same name. There’s a workaround which involves doing mixed casing per header as a hack (e.g. https://github.com/blakeembrey/node-bit-string-mask).\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually, sorry, this response is just noise! I misread the logs above. Looks like it already does this (logs are hard to read on mobile).\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Are you using Cloudfront or any other tooling?",
