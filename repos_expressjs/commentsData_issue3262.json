    "body": "Hi @loretoparisi it seems like you are having issues with integrating different modules together in Express, so I would first try to use the support forum https://gitter.im/expressjs/express to work through your issue until you have a reason to believe there is a bug to fix somewhere and can articulate the bug.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps! Lots of users are around of the support forum to help, but unfortunately this is not really a support forum.",
