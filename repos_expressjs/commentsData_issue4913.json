I have no idea why this does not work.\r\n\r\nMaybe (!) resetting the sync counter to 0 might be a solution (it fixes the test above). But I do not know if this really solves the problem.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n     // max sync stack\r\n     if (++sync > 100) {\r\n+      sync = 0\r\n       return setImmediate(next, err)\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The commit might be wrong.\r\n\r\nWithout restting the `sync` variable, the `setImmediate` is called every time after the 100th invocation. Shouldn't it be only called every 100th time (thus, needs to be reset to 0 like in my diff above)?\r\n\r\n3. The test does not really test the problem.\r\n\r\nThe new tests in `test/Route.js` do not seem to test anything. I have not been able to reproduce a stack overflow with the two tests provided and the `return setImmediate(next, err)` removed altogether.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/708ac4cdf5cd0a658d62490a9f4d78d3e1ec6612#diff-17d20c9109837cc254f08f350d3d75f46c629e3cd490aaca0beb9903571ac1ec\r\n\r\n**=> I highly recommend reverting 708ac4cdf5cd0a658d62490a9f4d78d3e1ec6612 as it does not seem to fix anything (at least nothing that's in the test) but introduces new problems (like this issue).**",

Unfortunately I really cannot revert the change, as it was a fix for an alleged security issue (though I don't really agree it is a vulun, but it does lead to an unrecoverable server crash in the right conditions), as without it, a request could cause a server crach due to stack overflow. I will look in to your test case above so we can work forward from here to fix the issue caused by this fix.",
