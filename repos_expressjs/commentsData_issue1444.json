    "body": "I'm building some dynamic router on top of express (e.g. could be driven by a db), and have the user specify whether she wants the route to be interpreted as a string or as a regex. Built it all, including my unit tests, and they failed because express basically treat the two cases the same. Not super urgent for me, but maybe it's somewhat of a security issue, so that if you register a route from a semi-authority (say an admin which can configure routers), the developer basically has to sanitize the string to make sure it doesn't match a valid regex.\n",
