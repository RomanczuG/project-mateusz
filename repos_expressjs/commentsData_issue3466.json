    "body": "For `req.query`, depending on your `query parser` setting you are either using the [`qs` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) (default) or the [`querystring` module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/querystring.html), so the types would depend on the features of those modules. For `req.params`, you can use the [`app.param` feature](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.param) to parse the URL pieces into the types you are expecting.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for further help, please stop by our support channel https://gitter.im/expressjs/express",
