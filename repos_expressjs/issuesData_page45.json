    "body": "May I purpose a new kind of helper. We currently have two kinds of helpers: helpers and dynamicHelpers. Given the example:\n\n```\napp.helpers({\n  obj: {foo: 23, bar: 11}\n});\napp.render('file.ejs', {locals:{obj:{foo:5}}});\n```\n\nobj.bar will no longer be a local within file.ejs. The locals will overwrite the helper obj entirely, rather than just merge it's properties.\n\nHowever, it would be useful to be able to merge locals with helpers. So with this:\n\n```\napp.mergingHelpers({\n  obj: {foo: 23, bar:11}\n});\napp.render('file.ejs', {locals:{obj:{foo:5}}});\n```\n\nobj.bar will still equal 11 within file.ejs. This is because mergingHelpers would define helpers that are recursive when locals overwrite them. This means that the locals object will merge with the merginHelpers object recursively.\n\nI think this concept fits nicely with the the current set of two helpers, completing it with helpers, dynamicHelpers and now mergingHelpers! :D\n",

The query parameters were being lost because of the way the server was handling requests.\nBasically further up somewhere the req.url was losing the query string, and this.use in Server was always clearing the query of the request then rebuilding if the url had a query string.\n\nSetup to see this bug was:\n- Basic server with it's own set of routes.\n- app.use('./apath', require('anotherServer'));\n- A route in anotherServer spitting out query string\n- Request the route in anotherServer and watch query string dissapear.\n\nLet me know if you need more information / you have any suggestions, it's blocking my project from working as expected.\n\nThanks,\nDanny.\n",

That's been done now, but it seems like the transition to NODE_ENV hasn't been completed.\n\nGiven an app.js like this:\n\n<pre><code>var app = module.exports = require('express').createServer();\napp.configure('production', function () {console.log(\"Express: production\");});\napp.configure('development', function () {console.log(\"Express: development\");});</code></pre>\n\n\n<pre>$ spark -E production\nExpress: development\nSpark server(2991) listening on http://*:3000 in production mode</pre>\n\n\nHowever setting NODE_ENV works:\n\n<pre>$ NODE_ENV=production spark\nExpress: production\nSpark server(2992) listening on http://*:3000 in production mode</pre>\n\n\nI see two possible fixes, either Express should check <tt>(process.sparkEnv && process.sparkEnv.name)</tt> before falling back to development in server.js, or spark should set process.env.NODE_ENV when it encounters the -E switch or any of its aliases. Probably the latter :)\n\nBest regards,\nPapandreou\n",

Also it is impossible to manually set the [controller name] as a local variable within the controller as no matter what that token is going to be assigned by the render override. \n\nhere is the patch: MVC line 162\n\n```\n        if (obj.locals){\n          options.locals = obj.locals;\n          delete obj.locals;\n        } else {\n          options.locals = {};\n        }\n       // options.locals = obj.locals || {};\n        // Expose obj as the local IF it has not already been assigned\n        if ((action == 'index') && (!options.locals.hasOwnProperty(plural)))  {\n            options.locals[plural] = obj;\n        } else if (!options.locals.hasOwnProperty(name)) {\n            options.locals[name] = obj;\n        }\n        return res.render(path, options, fn);\n```\n",

Index page loads and the .json route loads but the users or /users/1 etc all fail with a 500. \n\nI'm guessing that I'm missing something super simple.. any help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks and congrats on building what looks to be a killer framework.\n",

Here are my opinions.\n\nThe good:\n- we could pass \"promise\"-like objects to the view and forget about them (db queries etc)\n- async helpers\n\nThe bad:\n- complicates, and in turn slows down the view system\n- error reporting becomes nearly impossible (if we write to the socket before a query is finished for example)\n\nthere would extremely minimal performance gains from async views, perhaps in some cases even a decrease. if we wish to perform error handling in a reasonable way we cannot write to the socket before all promises are complete, meaning the view system basically becomes control flow. This is why I am personally against the idea, however I do like the idea of supporting async helpers which could simply `next(err)` on exception\n",
