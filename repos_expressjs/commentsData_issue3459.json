    "body": "So now that I'm at a computer, I can give a more expressive answer :) The license only applies to our content (just like if you have a license it is just for your content). The share-alike part is only for the case where you take the original content (logo) and slightly modify in some way and ideally you're supposed to make that modified logo available under the same license. Just using the logo is the attribution part, which is not really necessary in this case, since the logo itself identifies the attribution. Just plop the logo wherever and you're good to go.",
