The code has been this way since ~2009, and from all this time, I'm not sure I've ever personally answered this question, so really had no idea the docs were lacking in this regard or it was confusing. People think in different ways, and that's OK -- it's pretty much the main reason we really like it when we get docs PRs because when it makes sense to us, it's hard to understand how it wouldn't make sense to someone else, if that makes sense.",
