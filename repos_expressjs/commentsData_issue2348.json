    "body": "> At least remove all this misleading information about mounted apps in this section of documentation\n\n@hacksparrow will take care of this for you.\n\n> Maybe add a convenient API to generate absolute mountpath-aware paths, I think app.path could be a good candidate\n\nNot going to happen. `mountpath` is too rich; it can be an array, a regexp, or other things can `app.path()` is basically broken and will be removed soon. `req.baseUrl` is probably a better candidate to use, if anything. You can then do `res.redirect(req.baseUrl + '/other/path')` (`req.baseUrl` will _never_ contain the trailing slash, so you can consistently concatenate).\n",
