    "body": "This behavior is not very clear (using 4.12.2). Take for example, registering routes in this order:\n\n```\napp.get('/resource/:id', getHandler);\napp.head('/resource/:id', headHandler);\n```\n\nDone this way you will never _ever_ hit the `headHandler`. However, if you reverse the order:\n\n```\napp.head('/resource/:id', headHandler);\napp.get('/resource/:id', getHandler);\n```\n\nThe `headHandler` is called on HTTP `HEAD` requests, and the `getHandler` is called on `GET`.
