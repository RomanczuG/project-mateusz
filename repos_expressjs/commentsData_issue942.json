    "body": "hi @visionmedia,\n\nthanks for merging my pull request. however, i have a question about the tweak you made after the merge.\n\nthe reason why i did\n\n> var eol = os.platform === undefined ? '\\r\\n' : ('win32' === os.platform() ? '\\r\\n' : '\\n');\n\ninstead of\n\n> var eol = 'win32' == os.platform() ? '\\r\\n' : '\\n';\n\nis that node 0.4 doesn't have os.platform function. if you are planning to obsolete node 0.4 with express 2.x then i think that will work fine, but if you are still planning to keep node 0.4 support for express 2.x, then i think the code should check for availability of os.platform.\n",
