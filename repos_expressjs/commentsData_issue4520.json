Right now it is \"Programmer 😎 has invites you to join Express JS\".\r\n\r\nI'm thinking the logo should ideally be the ExpressJS logo instead of the JS logo (do we hace the rights to use the JS logo there?). We should also style \"Express JS\" consistent with the way the project writes it -- either just \"Express\" or \"Express.js\". I'm also not sure about whatever the anime logo that is above it, could probably just make that the Express logo, actually.\r\n\r\nWhat do folks think? Otherwise I think it looks good 👍",

Also due to the high amount of messages sent in discord, it's impossible to list any message in google. Instead, discord has its own search engine, with various features.\nAlso for you and other guys who don't want discord server -\nIF YOU HATE DISCORD, ITS NOT ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS! JUST KEEP QUIET AND MOVE ON.. You're all just popping up and making the queue to approve this request more longer.\nI would stop talking about discord if google groups is closed. Just because google groups is too old/not popular and doesn't have all the features like in discord.",

(Quoted from https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/4520#issuecomment-816527152)\r\n> I'm gonna get mad... (Quoted from https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/4520#issuecomment-820616129)\r\n\r\nHey @sayantan300, I think you need to be a bit more polite and considerate. But anyways, replying to the other parts of your response...\r\n\r\n> The DISCORD SERVER DOESN'T NEED ANY NEW COMMUNITY HELPERS, THE MEMBERS THERE CAN HELP EACH OTHER'S.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, it could be self-sustained the way it already is. That still doesn't answer my question either. That wasn't my question in the first place too! Also, as @samsch rightly pointed out at https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/4520#issuecomment-816262797, an even more active server exists.\r\n\r\nHere's the link he gave: https://discord.gg/vUsrbjd So **_even if_** Discord should be added, that should be the link in my opinion.\r\n\r\n>Also due to the high amount of messages sent in discord, it's impossible to list any message in google. Instead, discord has its own search engine, with various features.\r\n\r\nThat's not right. I wasn't referring to Google, but since you mentioned it, Google is well capable of indexing, and they have sufficient computing power to do so. Not a big deal. In fact, Google indexes Telegram. The actual reason is that Discord doesn't allow access as you need to be signed in.\r\n\r\n> Also for you and other guys who don't want discord server -\r\n\r\nI never said `I don't want Discord`. All I'm asking you is for some clarification on why you feel it's more useful than GitHub Discussions as I mentioned in my [previous message](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/4520#pullrequestreview-635023831):\r\n```\r\nHaving too many platforms make it hard not only for maintainers to respond but also for developers/programmers to search things for. Also, Discord isn't indexed by search engines. It's a closed space and ideally meant for gamers and hackathons.\r\n\r\nIn fact, since GitHub Discussions already exists, it's a major boon for developers/programmers considering how much GitHub is used anyways and it's also indexed by search engines.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> IF YOU HATE DISCORD, ITS NOT ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS! JUST KEEP QUIET AND MOVE ON.. You're all just popping up and making the queue to approve this request more longer.\r\n\r\nI never said I hate it either. In fact I'm an active user of Discord and also a part of 35 different communities currently. So yes, I did do my part of the research. And also, to add on, just like you, everyone is entitled to their opinion. So, saying `JUST KEEP QUIET AND MOVE ON` is simply not right.\r\n\r\n> I would stop talking about discord if google groups is closed. Just because google groups is too old/not popular and doesn't have all the features like in discord.\r\n\r\nI'm not asking you to stop talking. I'm interested in having the conversation with you rather, by asking why not GitHub Discussions over Discord? To quote me again:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHaving too many platforms make it hard not only for maintainers to respond but also for developers/programmers to search things for. Also, Discord isn't indexed by search engines. It's a closed space and ideally meant for gamers and hackathons.\r\n\r\nIn fact, since GitHub Discussions already exists, it's a major boon for developers/programmers considering how much GitHub is used anyways and it's also indexed by search engines.\r\n```",
