    "body": "Hello, **misabhi** this the correct behaviour. I must admit when I first started with node and express I had the same question.  Let me walk you through it. I have created a little [gist](https://gist.github.com/ghinks/08741838ce54afdc37f9c7ebe613a1d8) with this example.\r\n\r\nIf we have the 2 routes with similar base paths as you have like this \r\n```\r\nconst routeHandlerOne = (req, res) => {\r\n  console.log(\"example handler 1\");\r\n  res.send(\"route handler 1\")\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst routeHandlerTwo = (req, res) => {\r\n  console.log(\"example handler 2\");\r\n  res.send(\"route handler 2\")\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\napp.get(\"/api/assessment/:id\", routeHandlerOne);\r\napp.get(\"/api/assessment/audit\", routeHandlerTwo);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the route **/api/assessment/:id** is a general case of **/api/assessment/audit**\r\n\r\nWhen you put the more specific case of **/api/assessment/audit** first it will be picked as the exact match. This will allow all other routes that are a general case of **/api/assessment/:id** to be selected afterwards.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
