So if you send a application/json request to the server you might want it to respond one way rather than if text/html is sent.\n\nI implemented the callbacks as such:\n\n```\n    get('/', function() {\n            this.content('html', function() {\n                    return 'this is some html'\n            })\n            this.content('json', function() {\n                    return 'this is some json'\n            })\n    })\n```\n\nYou can check it on on my fork here: [http://github.com/rmontgomery429/express/tree/content_type_callbacks](http://github.com/rmontgomery429/express/tree/content_type_callbacks)\n\nLet me know what you think.\n",

I've currently ported a bunch of the CI (codeigniter) app structure over to express to make it better for large apps and I'm also in the process of porting over http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/active_record.html I'll keep you posted on those.\n",

    "body": "Hi, new to Express and just playing around with it a bit. I was working with the chat example app. I noticed the following:\n\n1) Run chat server. \n2) Start a moderately concurrent load test with ab: 'ab -n10000 -c20 http://127.0.0.1:3000/'\n3) Hit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. The page loads fairly quickly.\n4) Modify app.js to include enable('cache view contents') in the configure() callback\n5) Stop ab, restart the server, start the ab again.\n6) Hit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Observe in the resource timeline that '/' has loaded quickly, but app.js, style.css, and jquery.js are hung.\n7) Stop ab\n8) Observe that the static files come down immediately after stopping ab\n\nOn my machine, the server was serving '/' requests by ab in ~100ms. So you would reasonably expect to each browser request to be served fairly within 2s or so. However, I've let it run and after even 30s+ or sometimes the static file requests still have not been honored.\n",
