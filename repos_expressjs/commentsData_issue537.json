It would be great to define an object helper that has a bunch of default properties, and then you're able to overwrite them individually with mergingHelpers. :)\n\nOr you could just make the app.helpers function behave like this. But then that might not be backwards compatible with existing Express applications.\n",

    "body": "Probably best to make it a separate function then (mergingHelpers). Here's a good example of where you could use this:\n\n  app.mergingHelpers({\n    header: {\n      title: 'My Site',\n      showNavigation: true,\n      logo: 'default'\n    }\n  });\n\nNow with this I can override these defaults when I choose to render a template. Rather than hardcoding these defaults within the templates them selves, I have them here for easy modification; if ever I decide to change the defaults, I have them right here.\n\nIn my template files I wouldn't need to do any `typeof header.tile != 'undefined'` or such. All I need to do is assume a variable is defined, because it is, it's defined via helpers.\n\n  <!doctype html>\n  <html>\n  <head>\n    <title><<-header.title>></title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <header>\n      <<\n      switch(logo) {\n        case 'blue':\n          >> <img ... /> <<\n          break;\n        default: >> <img ... /> <<\n      }\n      if (header.showNavigation) { >>\n        <nav>...</nav>\n      << } >>\n    </header>\n\nSo you can see how I can now just use this header namespace to hold all the settings for the header template/partial. I don't need to worry about a certain property being defined or not, so long as I define it with mergingHelper.\n\nThis comment is becoming to long...\n",
