    "body": "Well, the errors are done a specific way, with a bunch of properties you should be using. If the web site has a mistake, please make a pull request or request it be fixed :)\n\nOur generator https://github.com/expressjs/generator correctly provides a default error handler that handles these kinds of things correctly. You simply have a bug in your error handler, assuming that all errors will be 500, but this is not how error-handling works in Express.\n\nThe reason these comes back into the error handling is because how else could you possibly override what the display of this would look like otherwise? The errors are done as middleware, just like in requests, with tons of flexibility.\n\nIf you are designing a custom error handler, you have to interface with the incoming `error` objects as designed. If the express website can be expanded with more information, that can absolutely happen (and I believe it is currently known that the website really lacks in describing how error handling works, currently).\n",
