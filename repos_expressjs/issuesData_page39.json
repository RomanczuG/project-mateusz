Here's my code:\n\n```\nvar express = require('express'),\n    cons = require('consolidate'),\n    port = process.argv[2] || 8080,\n    app = express();\n\napp.engine('html', cons.hogan);\napp.set('view engine', 'html');\napp.set('views', __dirname);\n\napp.configure(function() {\n  app.use(express['static'](__dirname));\n});\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res) {\n  res.render('index', {\n    hi : 'world'\n  });\n});\n\napp.listen(port);\n```\n\nNow granted, this is for a quick server that I want to throw up to test something. But the problem is never immediately clear to me and I'm not sure that static should be handling `index.html` especially when it seems that express advocates overriding how html files are handled. \n\nExample (from consolidate readme):\n\n```\n// assign the swig engine to .html files\napp.engine('html', cons.swig);\n```\n\nIt's definitely a corner-case, but I don't really see the benefit of having static handle `index.html`, other than saving one route for static webpages. Unless it's for caching, but then maybe all html files should be handled by the static  middleware and `app.engine('html', ...)` isn't recommended.\n",

That's transparent most of the time, but JSONP is all about returning JSON wrapped into JavaScript and, as such, the JSON that gets wrapped must conform to the JavaScript language. `JSON.stringify` does not guarantee that (well, it depends on the parser used, but the one in node.js does not).\n\nIn particular, the following code will trigger a JavaScript exception if fetched from within a Web browser:\n\n```\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express.createServer();\n\napp.enable('jsonp callback');\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n res.json({ property: 'hello\\u2028world' }, { 'Content-Type': 'text/javascript' });\n});\napp.listen(5000);\n```\n\nThe separator characters need to be escaped before they are returned, with code such as:\n`body.replace(/\\u2028/g, '\\\\u2028').replace(/\\u2029/g, '\\\\u2029')`\n\nSee [JSON: The JavaScript subset that isn't](http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset) for a good summary of the problem.\n",

Conceivably some websites may rely on the above behavior. But it seems really insidious and misleading, and probably the following is more common:\n\n```\napp.configure(function(){\n    app.set('view options', { layout: false });\n});\napp.configure('development', function(){\n    app.set('view options', { layout: false, pretty: true });\n});\n```\n\nwhich won't break from these changes  -- it will just be redundant.\n",

It expects to be passed a function with the same exact signature as `utils.lookupView`.\n- Updated `App.render`, which now passes the lookup function to use to the `View`, in the already-existing options object. Additionally, responsibility to send error message when a view does not exist has been moved to the `View.lookup` method.\n- Updated `View.lookup`, whose only responsibility is to call the actual view lookup function passed by `App.render`, and throw an error if not found.\n- Updated `View.render`, which now is responsible to call `View.lookup`.\n- Also fixes a small indentation problem from my pull request [#1100](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/pull/1100). Sorry about that.\n",

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nI want to use Hogan.js for the templating language in a new 3.x project. However, I don't know which of the libraries to use. Can you help?\n\nSo far:\n[3.x wiki](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki) says it supports hulk-hogan, but consolidate says it supports Hogan.js...\nhulk-hogan also recommends express-hogan which has a few more watchers.\n\nIs there a sample app using 3.x that also uses hogan syntax and partials?\n\nthanks a lot,\nSteve\n",

    "body": "I was consulting the examples and various other source codes and saw that upon authentication, the best practice is to \"regenerate\" the session before setting the user. Is there behavior change on this by any chance?\n\nThis is the gist of the code I tried to ran modified one of the gists in another discussion: https://gist.github.com/2018853\n\nThe expected result would be as follow:\n    /login -> user input \"test\"\n    / -> test\n\nThe actual results is as follow:\n    /login -> user input \"test\"\n    / -> none\n\nI expect the req.session.user to persist in the new session but it seems to me like after the redirection, another new session is regenerated and session.user is lost (undefined). I'm not sure if this is by design or a known behavior. The user variable however will stay if I do not regenerate the session.\n",
