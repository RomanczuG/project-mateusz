    "body": "This is because in your non-working example, you are calling `proxyChooser('acme')` -- i.e. invoking the `proxyChooser` function with one argument, which is why the second argument is `undefined` -- you're not passing it in.\r\n\r\nWithout the full code is's hard to understand what the correct solution is -- I don't know what the `proxy` function is or how it works to give a good recomendation. I would suggest popping over to our support channel https://gitter.im/expressjs/express\r\n",
