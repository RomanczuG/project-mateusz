    "body": "This happens because the request is handled at two different \"routing\" levels and routers. The app.use is handled by the apps router and then passes on to the router you created. Params are not preserved in such cases. One reason for this is if you had another :id in your route in the nested routers there would be conflicts. If you want to use params they must happen at the same routing level.\n\nIn your case, if you do want to capture the id, you will need some middleware at the app router level that captures the id into some app specific variable (you could even assign it onto the request object since that is the same) this becomes an app decision and your responsibility to avoid conflict.\n",
