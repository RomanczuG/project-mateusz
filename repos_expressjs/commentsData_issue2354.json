    "body": "Are you sure express is actually setting it? Have you printed\n\n```\nconsole.dir(rea._headers)\n```\n\nwithin express or used wireshark, or have you just been looking in the browser console, which could be displaying whatever it feels like? I ask because sendFile and it's functionality not only doesn't care what the browser is, it also consults only one thing to get the content type: the file extension.\n\nYou can always try\n\n```\nres.type('my/type')\nres.sendFile(filePath)\n```\n\nAnyway, can you provide more information? What is the file type you are seeing in Chrome?\n",
