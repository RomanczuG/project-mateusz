Perhaps it could be useful if you are trying to convince us to elaborate more on your statements.\n\n> I think it would be a good idea to remove some of the micro package or single function dependencies which aren't heavily reviewed.\n\nSo this statement brings a lot of questions to my mind:\n1. Do you have a list of specific modules in my here and can you state the specific concerns for each one? Perhaps the issue is with something in particular but we are gettin g lost in the discussion being too generic here.\n2. Can you define what makes a module less popular or reviewed? I have personally read the code for all current dependencies, and as the policy is to pin specific versions, and they typically do not have sub dependencies, the code won't change without us version bumping it, at which time we review it once again.\n3. I don't understand what makes a dependency with a single function bad. Can you explain? Eventually this very package will only consist of a single function. What that make express a terrible module no one should depend on any more?\n",

We shouldn't inline anything.\n\nThat being said, I think we should consider what modules we use. If we maintain the dependency, that's okay. If we don't, we should either have some control of it or be assured that it's maintained by someone we trust. For example, I'd prefer if our dependencies preferred lodash utilities vs random micro libraries (like left-pad).\n",

    "body": "Has anyone considered registering the npm organization for `expressjs`?  This would also enable us to publish our own safe forks under the `@expressjs` scope on npm.  I don't think this is _necessary_, but is is one step we could do to utilize safe and controlled versions of deps not maintained by expressjs core team members.\n\nThere is one other step we could take that is a bit more extreme, but might actually be better than the other proposed solutions I have seen from the community.  That solution would be publishing fully packaged versions of express where all deps were bundled into one file using `browserify --node`.  This would provide multiple benefits:\n- Secured and tested dependencies.  At publish time the deps were vetted, we could be sure that no third party had the ability to modify the code after publish\n- Faster startup times.  Because the built version of express would be a single file, the node runtime would actually start faster\n- Users could be assured that the code they are running was the EXACT code vetted by the express core team, not relying on NPM policy to get in the way\n\nWe could even do something like publish a version called `express-bundled` that would be a dependency that users can install, and let users who want to \"risk\"[1] installing all of express' sub dependencies individually do so as usual. \n\n[1]. I really don't think it is a risk.\n",

Clearly a lot more forethought has gone into them than I originally thought. Thanks for talking it through and giving me more context.\n\nPlaying devils advocate, I think the only other argument that could be made regarding switching the dependencies to something like lodash is for consistency e.g. lodash has a couple of your single function dependencies as part of it e.g. it has both a merge and a flatten function. \n",

    "body": "I also agree that it makes sense to move to `Object.assign` in places where objects are being merged, as it is essentially a standardized way to perform merges. I would say unless there is a very good case to make that switch within the 4.x line, we should add that as a desire to have in the 5.0 release instead.\n\nAs for the general discussion, I don't think there is much more to say on the topic. In general, a lot of these kinds of \"micro libraries\" are eventually being incorporated into JavaScript itself (like `Object.assign`) and it's just a matter of time before just using the native operations from JavaScript instead.\n\nIn addition, we talked about the desire to keep out copy-and-pasted code (why would we want to have a file full of tests for a merge function, btw, or PRs every so often trying to optimized this?). From the talking, we also mentioned that we do thoroughly vet the dependencies that Express.js takes on, typically almost all are covered by the Express TC, just because it works out better in the long run this way.\n\nWe also touched on the dependency policy Express.js has had, though before closing this issue, I will outline it here for those reading:\n- A dependency that is added is thoroughly-read from top-to-bottom for the code it contains, looking for if it feel well-written.\n- We look at the test suite of that module, and weigh the complexity of the code to the thoroughness of the test suite, and how often it is run (is it setup in Travis for every commit?).\n- We only depend on exact versions of dependencies that are not under the Express TC (formally it was those that are not under the main developers, even personal ones).\n- We take into consideration to the dependencies of our dependencies, applying this same logic. A large version range on a dependency of a dependency may disqualify it from being our dependency, due to general risk of stuff randomly breaking.\n- The entire \"npm unpublish\" situation we have been aware of as long as npm has existed with this capability, though I personally have never agreed that that should be a feature of a central code registry. This is not something that can easily be overcome, so unless there is knowledge of some immanent danger/disaster, we will deal with anything along those lines as they happen, not prior.\n\nI hope all that makes sense. If there is a desire to discuss general dependency policies, I welcome someone opening an issue at https://github.com/expressjs/discussions/issues to have a longer discussion.\n\nI'm going to close this issue for now, as I think the discussion is generally over and has been around for 2 days. The topic has started to trail into changing different things, rather than just not depending on various modules just because.\n",
