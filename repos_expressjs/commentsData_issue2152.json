Here is the content: https://gist.github.com/dougwilson/7230b4afb4c0928d5e30\n\n> Just running node server.js also causes the issue so I don't think it can be liveloader.\n\nBut the live reload stuff is being used as middleware in the config. You said that your other express app doesn't do that. Perhaps try removing things from the broken app one-by-one until it starts working to find the issue?\n\n> I agree doesn't not look like an express issue but I was hoping you guys can shed some light on it.\n\nUnfortunately I have never used pretty much any of the modules you are using and this is a issue tracker, rather than a help center. You may have much better luck getting an answer from somewhere like stackoverflow.com\n",
