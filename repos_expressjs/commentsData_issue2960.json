    "body": "Yes, there are sync parts of the `res.render` API (which sucks), but it will be addressed in Express 5.0, as we cannot address it without breaking the view engine compatibility.\n\nStarting your application with `NODE_ENV=production` or setting the cache to true for rendering will cause file system activities only once per view at startup, which makes this a non-issue while the application is fully running in production, since no sync file systems are called since the views are cached.\n\nPlease also see the comments in the duplication issue @DavidTPate pointed out :)\n",

Probably I needed to spend a lot of time to figure out why my handlebars templates only refreshed on server reload, didn't realising that few days ago I added `production` environment variable to my OS! :)\n\nBut is there a way to set `express-handlebars` templating engine for always refresh from the disk on refresh? After all, this is don't needed when my static site goes to production (blog posts already read from a json file which is cached on every browser reload), but it will be good to know how I can turn on the viewing template reload on every browser load.\n",
