    "body": "You may have wanted to wait for a repo first :) This is obviously a knee-jerk reaction to the \"left-trim\" thing, which is not something I am concerned about. In fact, you'll generally find almost all our dependencies are controlled by us anyway.\n\nThe goal of Express 5 is laid out in the 5 pull request, and that is for there to only be a single file, without a giant \"utils\" file. Looking through our history you'll see there was a lot of hard work to chop down the existing \"utils\" file, especially because there was a time when people would require Express just for the utils.\n",
