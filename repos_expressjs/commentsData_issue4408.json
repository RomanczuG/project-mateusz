    "body": "Thank you so much @Qard ! Espeically if this can not be landed relatively soon, you should close this PR on this repo and instead open it on our upstream of the router: https://github.com/pillarjs/router . In the Express 5 branch, all of this code is deleted, so your changes would be lost if merged here. If your changes land in the router 1.x branch, they are automatically ported into the \"legacy\" Express 4.x code case, which is what your PR here is against.",
