    "body": "So, just to be clear: Express 5.x dropping support for Node.js 0.10 does not mean _Express_ will drop support for Node.js 0.10. Just like Express 3.x has lived in parallel with Express 4.x for almost 2 years now, Express 4.x will continue to live alongside Express 5.x.\n\nTo answer @aredridel , not dropping 0.10 from Express 5.x means that 5.x would be hard-pressed to consume and support various features in the newer V8 and Node.js platform (things like Intl, generators, promises, and more). Because we want to make longtivity promises, this means that once Express 5.0 comes out, an Express 6.0 is unlikely to appear until 1 year or more later, putting it further behind the curve.\n\nHere is a little mock-up support example:\n\n```\nYear             0      1      2      3      4      5      6\n\nExpress 3 (0.8 ) +--------------------+\nExpress 4 (0.10)               +--------------------+\nExpress 5 (4?  )                      +--------------------+\n```\n\nTypically we'll have 2 active Express majors at a time (more than that gets harder, and the benefit decreases). The idea is that we can then perhaps up the minimum Node.js version with a major, since the previous major will still be around for a long time to come after the release. If you look back at the history of the 3.x line while 4.x has existed, we continued to backport every single new feature from Express 4.x into 3.x that was possible with 3.x's design. We intend to do the same with 4.x/5.x, which means 4.x will keep up; the release of 5.x does not move 4.x into \"maintenance mode\", either.\n",

    "body": "Hi @aredridel , I understand the concerns. This is only a discussion at this point without any actual commitment. We are looking to understand what the value is, of course. As for promises, we won't be importing any third-party library to do promises, so we would have to look into how to do promises in 0.10 without a `Promise` global available.\n\nWhen we implement any feature, we don't want it to be conditional on the version of Node.js you run on, but available on all supported Node.js versions of Express (thus allowing the user to know that running Express 5.2 on a supported Node..js version, they get all the promised features). Because of this, it makes dropping older versions more important, and hopefully should be possible since Express 4 will be _fully supported, even adding all new possible features from 5 as they come out_ :)\n\nIf we decide to bump the minimum version of Express 5, yes, it would delay Express 5 a little longer to ensure that Node.js 4 is in a more stable condition when this occurs.\n",

Or would not require searching for new ones.\n\nHow would developer know if a module that was used for express 4.0 or 3.0 will work for 5.0? Would I push code to production in this case? I do not know of any automatic tool that could tell me that (idea for greenkeeper.io devs)\n",
