    "body": "Hi @tunniclm, thank you for your pull request!\n\nSo, it would be really nice if you can make the script run on Windows machine, for Windows-centric contributors like myself. A shell script means that only a subset of contributors would be capable of maintaining the file. I suggest writing the script in Node.js itself, which would guarantee that all contributors could run the script, regardless of their operating system of choice.\n\nAlso, please try to clean up the file a bit, as there are some people listed multiple times. Of particular note is TJ himself is in there multiple times.\n\nAs far as the `LICENSE` file update goes, the current update is bound to cause confusion. This is because how `package.json` is setup, the `tools/` directory you added is not published to `npm`, but yet the modified `LICENSE` is going to be published to `npm`. I would personally recommend either moving the `LICENSE` file into the `tools/` directory, or even better, just inline the license in a comment block in the script itself.\n",

    "body": "@dougwilson All good points. I have written a node.js script instead of the shell/perl script. It still requires the git command-line client to be on the path to run.\n\nI spent a little time enhancing the duplicate removal in the script, however, I don't want to take it beyond same-email address  as it would open up the possibility of mistakes. For example, if you see \"John Doe john@gmail.com\" make a commit then later \"John Doe <john@doe.net\" then you might  say these were the same person, but you wouldn't really be sure.\n\nI will update the PR shortly.\n",
