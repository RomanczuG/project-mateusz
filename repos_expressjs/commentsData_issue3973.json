    "body": "I closed the PR because I think there needs to be an actual discussion on how this is going to work, because how this is implemented here is going to just be a worse experience for users. For example, if you set the dependency to `^4.16.1`, then when someone installs express 4.17.3, they can end up with the types for Express 4.23.0, which would be incorrect for that version of Express.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the body-parser example you can see in the `@types/express` package. That package is just not going to be possible to have as a dependency due to this:\r\n```\r\n$ npm info @types/express dependencies\r\n \r\n{ '@types/body-parser': '*',\r\n  '@types/express-serve-static-core': '*',\r\n  '@types/serve-static': '*' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see there, it will pull in _any_ version of `body-parser`, which means that when Express 5 comes out (the coming month) along with body-parser 2, then suddenly new Express 4 install types will be completely broken, since they will pull in the 2.x version of body-parser instead of 1.x.\r\n\r\nThe management of those dependencies and their ranges needs to be locked into the same ranges that match those actually shipped with the installed version of express so the typings are relevant to the actual exposed APIs of the installed express version.",

Generally, there's no harm in including whichever version of the types is available. It just makes development easier for us TS guys. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure what you're showing me in that last comment, because I see dependencies on _other_ @<!-- -->types packages, which won't pull `body-parser`. The only _genuine_ way to resolve this is to maintain your own types, but in the meantime, mediocre DefinitelyTyped versioning is unlikely to hurt anybody.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that types packages _do not pull non-types dependencies._ It would be the responsibility of DT's Express maintainers to ensure any severe versioning problems are mitigated.",
