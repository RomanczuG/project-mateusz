On a (partially related) side note, I did something similar for https://github.com/pillarjs/router/pull/29 (the standalone router, not in Express 4.x) which added support for the RAML type system using https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-path-match. If something like that lands, it would be straightforward to add a new path matching implementation with types (I know URI templates is of some interest too). \n\nEdit: That router is here: https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/osprey-router\n",
