    "body": "I think a better solution for this is to push logging to the application level.  Preferably by exposing an event for debug logs where the consumer can listen and log on their own.  And I think this needs to be something the node ecosystem adopts.  Because in the current state, like @rafis points out, package debug logging doesn't work in a large set of application environments.\n\nEDIT: this is actually something I have thought a lot on because we run about 90 SOA services, and it has been a bone I wanted to pick for a while and this is how we solved the problem internally :)\n",
