    "body": "Correct, rendering the view will perform a sync operation. You should have caching of views turned on and then only the first hit is sync, and further hits to that view are no file system operations at all.\n\nUnfortunately the views system was written in a way that cannot be converted to async without breaking everything, so it won't be completely async until Express 5.0. Using view caching in your production code will avoid this issue once each of your views have been hit once.\n",
