    "body": "> what does this mean?\n\nIt means\n\n``` js\nrenderPage(function(err, page){\n  if (err) return next(err)\n  res.send(page)\n})\n```\n\nwill suddenly send JSON if that function returned something weird by mistake (like a `null`). In `res.send`, `null` and `undefined` actually have two different behaviors because of the JSON stuff, which `res.end` does not suffer from (but `res.end` does not give automatic conditional responses and `ETag`s).\n\n> we could deprecate res.send(Buffer) since i don't see the point of doing that\n\nNo, I disagree. Using a `Buffer` is necessary if you are going to send your HTML in a different charset than UTF-8 (using something like `iconv` to encode). I do think that `Buffer` values should probably set the content-type to `text/html`, though. If `res.send` did not accept `Buffer`, then we'd need to add another method that did, because it's the way you get `ETag` and conditional responses for free.\n\nTL;DR I think `res.send` should just send `text/html` out, just like `res.json` only does `application/json`, instead of mixing a bunch of things together.\n",

Perhaps open a new issue for this and I can label it as \"Idea\" for discussion from everyone :) Ideally this pipeline would not be tied to `res.send`, but include `res.end` and all other ways to write out data (seems like it would be a good use-case for people wanting to do HTML-injection, URL-rewriting, etc.).\n\nI don't think that would particularly overrule this idea, since I think you idea, if implemented, should be more generalized than being specific to `res.send`. A lot of middleware, for example, do not use `res.send` since it is an express thing and they want to work with connect and vanilla Node.js servers.\n",

    "body": "Developer should stop using JSONP and go for CORS instead\n\nJSONP is unsafe and overly complicated to maintain on both backend and frontend. now days its very easy cuz we have this awesome framework that dose it for us :(\n\nIf we should have any shortcut to sending json cross domain it would be something with `res.cors().json(obj)` or with the help of middleware i would not encourage new user to use `res.jsonp()`. If they were using it then I would show a warning message to tell them a reason why, how to solve, and why its being deprecated.\n",
