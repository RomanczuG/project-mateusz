There is no automatic passing to next unless you are using async functions or you throw an error, which does not look like the case there.\r\n\r\nWe can certainly take a look to see what is causing he issue. Can you add here the full instructions for how to run your code and then what steps to take to then call it to reproduce the issue?",

Here is what I did, please let me know if I'm missing a steps or just not understanding.\r\n\r\nFirst I get the server set up and running (note I added `npm install` that was missing from the instructions above):\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://gitlab.com/touhidurrr/UncivServer-xyz.git\r\nCloning into 'UncivServer-xyz'...\r\nremote: Enumerating objects: 301, done.\r\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.\r\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\r\nremote: Total 301 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 297\r\nReceiving objects: 100% (301/301), 61.58 KiB | 10.26 MiB/s, done.\r\nResolving deltas: 100% (152/152), done.\r\n\r\n$ cd UncivServer-xyz/\r\n\r\n$ mkdir files\r\n\r\n$ npm install\r\n\r\nadded 74 packages, and audited 75 packages in 2s\r\n\r\n5 packages are looking for funding\r\n  run `npm fund` for details\r\n\r\nfound 0 vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n$ node src/server.js\r\n'Listening on 8080 ...'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I go to make the requests you mentioned above. I first create a 10mb file to make sure it's over the limit as you described, send that file with a PUT, and try to get it with the GET. I also checked the contents of the `files` directory. As far as I can tell, and when running the debugger, it never called `next()` after the 413, and the `server.put` you have was never invoked from it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ head -c 10485760 </dev/urandom >test-10mb.txt\r\n\r\n$ curl -i -XPUT -d'@test-10mb.txt' 'http://localhost:8080/files/game-data'\r\nHTTP/1.1 100 Continue\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 413 Payload Too Large\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Length: 17\r\nETag: W/\"11-tmVuFIBFGqHEdrkpbdAvMZFrreg\"\r\nDate: Wed, 25 May 2022 16:25:57 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5\r\n\r\nPayload Too Large\r\n\r\n$ curl -i 'http://localhost:8080/files/game-data'\r\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nContent-Length: 154\r\nDate: Wed, 25 May 2022 16:32:11 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n<title>Error</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n<pre>Cannot GET /files/game-data</pre>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n$ ls -lah files/\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 -  -    64B May 25 12:31 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  22 -  -   704B May 25 12:25 ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like I just may not be replicating correctly. If you can perhaps give exact commands like above I can be sure that I replicate exactly as you are doing so I can get to debugging it 👍 ",

Do you know the proper way to implement `413 Payload Too Large` at express?",

If you want to use one of the built-in body parsers, they also implement a size limit with a 413 as well. I'm sure there are also various third party middlewares as well if you need something different.",
