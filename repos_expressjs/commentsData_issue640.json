Keep your markups separated! Even if such a thing\nis possible (I am unsure) its just bad project architecture.\n\nAll the best.\n",

    "body": "The original source is from another platform. (think PHP style includes with Handlebars syntax for dynamic content).\r\n\r\nI would very much prefer to use a handlebars-style \"include\" if they do have it but what they have, Partials, seems to be only good if you want to reuse components on the same page.\r\n\r\nI don't mind doing:\r\n\r\n**index.html**\r\n{{ include header.html }}\r\nSome content {{Username}}\r\n{{ include footer.html }}\r\n\r\nbut I don't think the vanilla version of handlebars supports the above. Any 3rd party library will have to be vetted for as it is a commercial project so it's not easy to use any random libraries. (license issues, support, etc.)",

    "body": "In handlebars with that syntax 'include' is just a helper named include - from the aforementioned link. You can make 'helpers' for whatever you want in handlebars which makes it really super useful. \r\n\r\nIt works really well, as its quite a simple premise and keeps things pure. Perhaps take a look and investigate what can be done with those tools and the other handlebars extensions available.\r\n\r\nI think mixed-mode document rendering is like, the worst thing I can think of haha #iminhell #pleasesaveme so I wouldn't hold your breath on getting such a thing given to you.\r\n\r\nYou could ofcourse write your own view engine and apply both of these directly inside it's handlers.",
