    "body": "You know, do not really understand the error. Because anytime you can place `res.type` and sending the data will be different with `res.format`. As you can put `res.type` work only for a particular file type. Or it depends on the application as `res.format`. I'm sure the two functions are needed. Not to mention the fact that what really matters is how the user reaches the `header`. If you are not interested send HTML or plain text, not necessary to use `res.format`, because you can do shipped out `res.send` bypassing `res.format`.\n\nexample\n\n``` javascript\nres.type('json');\nres.send( MyObject );\n```\n",
