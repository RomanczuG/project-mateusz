What I believe your question is \r\n- is using a temp folder an issue?\r\n- does res.download work?\r\n\r\nSo my first advice is to create a local csv, hard code the res.download to use it and see if that works.

    "body": "Here is a working and complete example of [res.download](https://github.com/ghinks/express-issue-4292)\r\n\r\nI do not believe your issue is with express. But a regular coding issue associated with streams and files.\r\n\r\nIf you isolate the expressJS part and give a **full and complete but minimal** working demonstration of your code it would be possible to debug.\r\n\r\n( did you completely flush your streams?)\r\n\r\nThen as you have said this is a temp file or streams flushing issue.\r\n\r\nIn general this repo is for expressjs issues and not general coding questions. \r\n\r\nDo you think this is a general app question and not an express question. \r\n\r\nIf so please give me a nice smiley face, **close this issue**,  and do try stack overflow. We should be the place of last resort for express application coding questions. ",
