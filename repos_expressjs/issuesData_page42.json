    "body": "This is less an issue than a question, but I wasn't able to find a link to a users group, so here goes.\n\nI am interested in trying to use an express app to play host to several 'sub sites' as paths under the parent app.  Ideally these subsites could easily be stand-alone apps, or they could be mounted and accessible as a path under the parent.  So for example, let's say i have a blog application written in expressjs, I'd like to either be able to fire it up on its own, or copy it into a folder (e.g. /blog) under another express app's source tree, and have the blog functionality be accessible by going to http://parent-site.com/blog\" (and in concept, running hte sub-urls.  \n\nI saw a few things on the Server object that made me think there's an intended way to do this (e.g. the use() and mount() methods), but I couldn't quite get those to work as expected.  \n\nI was able to get it to work by requiring the blog, then adding a catch-all route for it like so:\n\napp.all('/blog/*',function(req,res,next){\n  var blogLocalPath = req.url.substring(req.url.indexOf('/blog')+5);\n  var handler = blog.lookup(blogLocalPath)[0];\n  handler.callbacks.forEach(function(callback){\n    callback(req,res,next);\n    });\n});\n\nbut that felt a bit like a hack and I haven't tested to see how well it works for a production site (e.g. haven't tested template paths and such yet, nor all the middleware stuff, etc).\n\nJust looking for advice on whether there's an intended approach or not, and if there is, what's the intended mechanism.\n\nThanks.\n",

    "body": "So, I’ve been doing local web development for ages using [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info).  And it works just fine.  \n\nThe thing is, when I started with MAMP ages ago, PHP + MySQL were hot shit.  And Apache was the infallible god of all web servers.\n\n…But not so much any more.  \n\nSo, I’ve been keeping my eyes open for an alternative to do local web development in.  \n\nIt needs to be human-friendly to set up, use, configure, and develop sites with.  And most importantly, I want to thoroughly understand how to migrate any tweaks I made to Apache to the new web server.\n\n---\n\nIt’s only been a few months since I heard about Node, npm, Connect, and Express.  I’ve never been a fan of Javascript (please don’t hate me! ☺), but it has always been used to do amazing things, so I use it when it can get me something in return that is un-gettable (or un-gettable for a reasonable effort).  \n\nExpress looks pretty impressive.  It’s one of those pieces of software that makes me forget my negative reactions to Javascript and drool over the possibilities going through my mind as I read through the example code snippets on the Express homepage.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me the most about Express was how its configuration is set up.  While reading through those blocks of code examples on the Express website, it looks so very simple.  My memory flashes back to an Apache configuration file and I want to vomit because the difference is just so _drastic_!  \n\n---\n\nBut it turns out, that thing that looks so attractive to me is exactly what confuses me the most about Express.  I’m _too set in my ways_ with Apache.  When I sit down to write some basic code for Express, I’m constantly interrupted by something like, “Okay, I know what I want to tell the server to do next…but I have absolutely no idea how to do it!”\n\nAnd flipping back and forth between the Express documentation and my editor helped a bit at first.  Then it became a lot of noise against the signal that was what I sat down to code.  And finally, I started to encounter questions to which I could find no answer on Express’ website.  \n\n---\n\nSo after all that… \n\n**First** , I’d like to request a new page for the Express documentation: \n\n**Migrating from Apache**. with examples of the most common stuff done in Apache configuration files, and how you’d code the same thing in Express.\n\n**Second,** I would like to ask about the following specifics that I want to set up Express to do:\n- XML Includes\n- Template engine using XSL / XQuery \n- Tell Express that files with extension `.blah` should be processed by program `blah` before being served (like telling Apache that `*.php` files should be processed with PHP)\n\n---\n\nYeah, I’m an XML junkie at heart.  I know, I know…it’s out of fashion, JSON is in, and by now you probably think I’m a misguided dinosaur or something.  And that’s okay.  ☺  (I’m not blind to XML’s flaws, I just have a deep-seated appreciation for its strengths.)\n\nBut even if you mock my love for XML, the underlying issue here is wrapping my brain around this radically different way of setting up a web server.  This is just so freakin’ alien.  Beautiful, wonderful, and elegant—but _alien_.  \n\nDo I have hope?\n",

    "body": "I refuse to do this until I'm happy with _how_ you define such a thing, but it would be useful for cutting down boilerplate code and everything we have now could be built on top of this, so I'm going to start brainstorming here :).\n\nWhile what we have right now is not really an issue, one might typically do something like the following:\n\n``` js\napp.all('/admin/*', ensure.loggedIn, ensure.role('admin'), accessLogger);\napp.get('/admin', admin.show);\napp.get('/admin/stats', stats.load, stats.json);\n```\n\nInternally this would be easier to manage with the following representation, but useful as a public API as well.  \n\n``` js\napp\n  .get('/admin')\n  .use(ensure.loggedIn)\n  .use(ensure.role('admin'))\n  .use(accessLogger)\n  .end(admin.show)\n  .get('/stats')\n    .use(stats.load)\n    .end(stats.json)\n  .get('/users')\n    .use(users.load)\n    .end(users.show)\n    .get('/:id')\n      .use(user.get)\n      .end(user.show);\n```\n\nI can see this getting out of hand quite quickly though, and if users dont abstract out the callbacks to some other file and try to define them inline along with `.get()` / `.use()` etc it _will_ look like hell. Another problem is that for an API like above, without having an explicit zero-arg `.end()` like jQuery we need an explicit end-point callback, though we can treat it as middleware internally. This method might look like this:\n\n``` js\n   .end = function(fn){\n     this.use(fn);\n     return this.pop();\n   }\n```\n\nwith this change the param callbacks could easily be normalized as well:\n\n``` js\napp.param(':uid', loadUser);\napp.get('/user/:uid', callback);\n```\n\ninternal representation:\n\n``` js\napp\n  .get('/user/:uid')\n  .use(loadUser)\n  .end(callback)\n```\n\nand:\n\n``` js\napp.param(':uid', user.load);\napp.param(':pid', post.load);\napp.get('/user/:uid', user.show);\napp.get('/user/:uid/post/:pid', post.show);\napp.del('/user/:uid/post/:pid', post.destroy);\n```\n\nwould be equivalent to:\n\n``` js\napp\n  .get('/user/:uid')\n  .use(user.load)\n  .end(user.show)\n  .get('/post/:pid')\n    .use(post.load)\n    .end(post.show)\n    .del()\n      .end(post.destroy);\n```\n\nwe could go further and take `.del(callback)` etc to be equivalent to `.del().end(callback)`.\n",

This may be closed again, but figured it didn't hurt to bring it back up. \n\nAnyways when working with script blocks jade appears to ignore escaping `/`.  For example:\n\n```\nscript\n  window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=\"javascripts/libs/jquery-1.6.1.min.js\"><\\/script>')\n```\n\nIt compiles down to\n\n```\n<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=\"javascripts/libs/jquery-1.6.1.min.js\"></script>')</script>\n```\n\nThis closes the `</script>` tag early making invalid Javascript and displaying in this case `')`\n\nConsidering that above is common boilerplate code, It would be nice to reconsider looking at this issue, especially because it could potentially mess up copy and paste JavaScript code.\n\nObviously you could potentially escape twice but hey that is slightly ugly.\n\n```\nscript\n  window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=\"javascripts/libs/jquery-1.6.1.min.js\"><\\\\/script>')\n```\n",

However, it's really difficult to use when you're trying to be class-y, since the \"this\" context varies wildly depending on how you use it.\n\nIf you use it in the app.get line, which is my preferred method, you get some sort of global context thing returned with this. If you do it as part of the route body, you get the more localized (and preferred) scope.\n\nTest case:\nmain file: https://gist.github.com/1108725\nbugmodel.js file:  https://gist.github.com/1108728\n\nIdeally, I'd prefer \"this\" in the route middleware style, to give you the same context you'd get when you use it inline w/ the route.\n\nMy workaround, for now, is to build functions into the main file, which give me the more localized context without modifying my classes.\n\nAlso, should note, I'm on Express 2.4.2 from NPM.\n",

    "body": "Having redirects becomes a natural part of any app as it grows over time and the URLs need to change. It's also nice to have redirects for URLs you expect your users might hit (e.g. /help -> /faq until you build a proper help section =D).\n\nWe thus found it really useful to add a simple `app.alias()` method both to declare redirects easily and to list them directly alongside our routes. Here's our simple implementation:\n\n``` coffee-script\n# convenience alias method for quick and simple redirects\n# TODO support passing through parameters, e.g. ':id' etc.\napp.alias = (from, to, status=301) ->\n    @get from, (req, res, _) ->\n        res.redirect to, status\n```\n\nAnd here's example usage:\n\n``` coffee-script\napp.alias '/aseem', '/aseemk'\napp.alias '/daniel', '/gasi'\napp.alias '/help', '/faq'\napp.alias '/users', '/people'\n```\n\nWhat do you think of adding a simple `app.alias()` convenience redirect wrapper like this to core? As a next step then, it would be great for it to pass parameters through too, e.g. `/users/:id` -> `/people/:id`.\n\nThanks for the consideration. =)\n\n/cc @gasi\n",

    "body": "I'm trying to devise a clean way to extend the Express  rendering system.  I might be mistaken, but it doesn't look like there is any way to take advantage of Express logic for rendering views/layouts without sending the result to the response? I know its possible to manually do this myself, but I'd much rather call/reuse code provided by Express.\n\nJust for a bit of context, I'd like this as  I'm building an add-on that would render any view as a PDF or PNG, rather than HTML.  So ideally, I'd like to take the same args as res.render, generate the HTML, convert it to PDF, then write it to the response.\n",

Would it be possible to map this method to a different, less confusing one?  @jkarsrud suggested something like `prop` which i think would lend itself to make a little more sense in that it can play both roles as a getter and a setter.\n\nexample:\n\n```\napp.prop('myProp', 'booya');\n// some code\nvar said = app.prop('myProp');\nconsole.log(said, ' grandma');\n\n// output: \"booya grandma\"\n```\n\nthoughts?\n",
