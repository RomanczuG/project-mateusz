    "body": "I spent quite a while googling for the state of express, and express 5.0 before landing on this issue. The [video State of the Union: Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxGt_3F0ULg&list=PLfMzBWSH11xYaaHMalNKqcEurBH8LstB8&index=7) from Node.js Interactive in Dec 2016 was exactly what I was looking for - and covers everything in great detail. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI know this sort of comment isn't that helpful in everyone's inbox, however I'm hoping it makes this video easier to find because I think it's important for the express community to hear about the new governance and that you're looking for more contributions. I personally was very interested in the router being a separate module & the GitHub project structure.\r\n\r\nMayhaps a link on the website and/or changing the title of this thread to be something more positive would be beneficial? Just a thought 😁 \r\n",
