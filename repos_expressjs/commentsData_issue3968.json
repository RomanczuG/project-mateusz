The change was available to test for a least 5 months prior to the release (https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/3778). We try to be careful but there are many unexpected use cases for Express.\r\n\r\nAs a side note of the report, can you share some thoughts on how we can improve sharing the changes ahead of time for compatibility testing? Should the window for releases be larger than 5 months lead time?",

    "body": "Thanks for the fast reply.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't think there's much hope in reaching people in my position. We use express as dependency wrapped inside a bunch of conventions about how we want to do microservices. So it's part of a much larger meta package. This meta package depends on a non-locked version of express, so we've now been getting the 4.17.0 for any new projects we create and any old project that updates its dependencies.\r\n\r\nWe could certainly have found the issues by testing ahead of time, but there are so many dependencies to keep track of, and we just honestly do not keep track of what's to come in any of them.\r\n\r\nI don't think you could have prevented this from happening through any reasonable communication means. We will generally only be looking at new dependency versions when we need to, not as a forethought kind of thing.\r\n\r\nI'm a little torn about whether to fix our meta package's use of express or whether to ask you to revert anything. There's an easy fix of using `response.statusCode = undefined` instead of `response.status(undefined)`, so we're in no way stuck.\r\n\r\nIf you want to pin down the old behavior of accepting undefined (something that was never explicitly mentioned - neither as allowed nor disallowed), I'll draft up a MR for a new test. I'll take a stab at that today or tomorrow. It's nearing end of workday in Denmark.",

Based on this issue, I think there is nothing we can do in the 4.x series around this. As an example, someone could be using `on-headers` module or similar to set a status code, which would happen after `res.send` is entered and there isn't a good point at which to detect such a thing.\r\n\r\nI agree with @wesleytodd here that we should just revert the behavior in the 4.x series and not touch anything around this.\r\n\r\n@emiln I think you for your feedback. Your answer is perfectly acceptable, as there is no way to catch everyone, so thanks for reflecting on it :) If you're interested in contributing tests to help lock in the behavior in 4.x that would be great 👍 . We should lock it to whatever the pre-4.17.0 behavior is and not introduce any new behavior around here due to the likely fragility.",
