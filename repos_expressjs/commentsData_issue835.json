    "body": "[express-dust](https://github.com/davglass/express-dust) has the same notion of template re-use build into the templating language.\n\nI would recommend that templating languages themself should handle partials and layouts.\n\nThis would also greatly increase client-side template re-use. Since templating languages with partials / inheritance baked on do not rely on an external rendering engine to handle partials.\n\nOverall a big +1 for removing it from the API. Someone may need to fix some kind inheritance or partial support into EJS to make the upgrade progress easier\n",

    "body": "yeah im starting to agree with the idea that template engines should just handle 100%. partial() has a few small benefits but there's no reason the engines cant provide similar, it's just more work I guess. ejs will be a bit tricky. The other concern is caching, we can a) expect engine.compile() to return a function and cache that b) defer all caching to the engine, which it may or may not support, but then again some engines dont even compile functions so it doesn't make sense to cache those ones\n",
