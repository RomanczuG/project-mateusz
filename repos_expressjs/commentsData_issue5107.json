    "body": "Hello, and thank you for your pull request. This has been proposed in the past but there have been too many concerns around DDoS vectors and other memory issues due to holding the full response body in memory while it is streamed to (potentially slow) clients. The API has been similar (though not the same) as what you have here, which has a lot of edge cases that don't really make it is a good candidate for general Express.js API. If that narrow capture range added here works for your specific app, you are always welcome to add it to your own Express.js instance, of course.
