    "body": "> I'm just curious, why does that happen\n\nBecause express is stack-based, i.e. everything executes in the order you define. This allows you to prefer certain paths over others, like so:\n\n``` js\nrouter.all('/user/:id', fn) // this is guaranteed to execute first since they are different routes\nrouter.get('/user/:id', fn)\n```\n\n`router.route` gives you a way to group the different verbs together if order is not as important.\n",
