Could be deployed to different architectures/linuxes so functionality over these osses is the same \n3. The examples would work always ;) \n\nWhat to do? \n1. Write Tests for the specific examples \n2. Integrate each of the examples in a build script / CI System\n3. Document how to work against these systems \n",

I didn't see an obvious way to set state on the request so that my first route handler could set a variable that I could reference in subsequent handlers.\n\nI added a local() function on request for this.  It's similar to param() but only gets/sets variables that you define.\n\nNot sure if this is a patch more appropriate to add to Connect, but let me know what you think.  \n\nTests included.\n\nthank you!\n\n-- James\n",

    "body": "Ok, i've tried to use the html5-boilerplate which was found in the express's wiki. I update all the submodule to the latest. Then, i tried to run the code. It looks fine until, it shows error on finding index.html even though the router already been told to render index.ejs instead of index.html. What happened here??. I already tried changing the render to send('hello world') and what i get is still the same. \"Cannot find index.html\". Then, when i disable the staticProvider option, it success route but i can't access all the css and stuff. Please help. thank you.\n",

    "body": "Well, I'm currently trying to find the way to detect the browser connection close. I've compared this module with \"Grasshopper\" and overall this is much more fun but the only problem is i can't get this simple code to work in \"Express\" but it works in Grasshopper. Do any of you here got any way on how to do this?. Here is my code for grasshopper.\n\n```\nthis.request.connection.on('close', function(error){\n    console.log('Browser Connection Closed!');\n});\n```\n\nWhich when i translated to \"Express\" would be something similar to this:\n\n```\nrequest.connection.on('close', function(error){\n    console.log('Browser Connection Closed!');\n});\n```\n",

This is the code I have right now:\n\n```\n    res.render( 'index', { locals : { user : user.__doc } }, function( err, html ) {\n        sys.puts( 'TEST' );\n        if ( err ) throw err;\n        sys.puts( html );\n    } );\n```\n\nThe page is rendered correctly, but the callback isn't called.\nThe console output is the normal logging, no output is generated by the callback.\nAm I doing something wrong or is it a bug in expressjs ?\n",
