    "body": "Yep, basically I'm exploring some ways of optimizing bundle size at the application level. Transforms could inline content into the bundle, like [urify](https://github.com/mattdesl/urify) for base64 images. Or another example might be a transform to inline CSS and inject it with insert-css:\n\n``` js\nrequire('static-css')(__dirname+'/style.less', { transform: 'less-stream' })\n```\n\nIn both cases the browserified bundle would _work_ because the transforms are listed, but it wouldn't be ideal for frontend. For images, it would be better to load from a URL with the `<img>` tag so that the browser can take advantage of caching. For CSS, it would be better to load them as a single (compressed) style sheet so that you don't end up with hundreds of `<head>` tags injected to the site. \n\nSo the plugin would only be for optimizing the bundle at the application level; overriding _all_ transforms throughout the bundle with some app-specific emitter. \n\nAn example with images here:  \nhttps://github.com/mattdesl/urify-example\n\nIf you have other ideas on how to tackle this, I'm all ears. Or maybe static analysis is not the right tool here, and using package.json a la Atomify would be more suitable?\n",
