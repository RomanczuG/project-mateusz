    "body": "@Gillingham \n\n> Is this a non-standard usage of the field?\n\n#1072 was about doing `b.require('thing-in-browser-field')` and as I mentioned there, that usage was not documented and did not appear to have test coverage either. So unless and until it gained those things, I consider it an accident.\n\nDoing `b.add('thing-in-browser-field')` is likewise not documented and apparently doesn't have test coverage either. Furthermore, there's now the uncertainty in #1248 about whether `b.add('some-module-not-in-browser-field')` is even supposed to work.\n\n> #1072 mentions a work-around using syntax like .require('./rampage/static-dev/js/rampage.js', {'expose': 'rampage'}) which I can confirm works with 10.1.2\n\nThat is _also_ not documented. See #1137. I would consider using the workaround I suggested in https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1072#issuecomment-70323972 for now:\n\n``` js\nb.add(require('/somedir/package.json').browser.rampage)\n```\n",
