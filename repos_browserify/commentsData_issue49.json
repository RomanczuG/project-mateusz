    "body": "Hmm, JSON.parse() is a big one too, and not available in IE7 or earlier. A combined additional script would make more sense. Also maybe I should just use Modernizr & yepnope or similar for any mobile site that isn't simple. But it would be nice if browserify could take care of bundling them.\n\nA lot of this is just thinking aloud. The main point I'm trying to make is that I'd like the docs to have a word about using node modules with browserify on sites that need to work in IE7+ or IE6+.\n",
