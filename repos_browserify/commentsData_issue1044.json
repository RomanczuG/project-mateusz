    "body": "~~I don't pretend to fully understand everything involved in this, but I believe what's happening in browserify >= 8.0.2 is that by the time you call `bundle()`, browserify has already `end()`ed the pipeline, resulting in `bundle()` no longer returning a writeable stream as vinyl-transform relies on (I think).~~\n\nOk, I still don't understand the inner workings 100%, but I think I've made progress. I don't believe vinyl-transform relies on the stream returned by `bundle()` being writable in this usage after all. In this case I think the refactored usage of vinyl-transform I suggested works (at least in my test) because the `bundle()` stream is already unpiped by the time the source vinyl-transform piped to it would write, so the write doesn't occur (and doesn't need to).\n\nI think the root cause of the error you guys are running into is the introduction of `process.nextTick(resolved)` to add the transforms. I think that results in the `bundle()` stream being piped to while in the `ended` state (unwritable), with pending write callbacks delaying the `finish` event that would unpipe the stream. So the pipe that vinyl-transform created attempts to write, triggering the error. I think that with the refactored usage I suggested, the write callbacks from the browserify pipeline have time to finish (resulting in it being unpiped before it's written to) because the tick that adds the transforms runs earlier and browserify calls `pipeline.end()` earlier.\n\nI will be interested to see what @substack has to say about this, but I believe there are at least 2 workarounds if you need to use browserify >= 8.0.2 in the meantime:\n\nWhere `entry`, `dest`, `b_opts`, and `some_xform` are whatever you want.\n\nRefactor usage of vinyl-transform as described in hughsk/vinyl-transform#1:\n\n``` js\ngulp.task('whatever', function () {\n  var b, browserified;\n\n  b = browserify(b_opts)\n    .transform(some_xform);\n\n  browserified = transform(function (filename) {\n    b.add(filename);\n    return b.bundle();\n  });\n\n  gulp.src(entry)\n    .pipe(browserified)\n    // ...\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(dest));\n});\n```\n\nUse vinyl-source-stream instead:\n\n``` js\ngulp.task('whatever', function () {\n  var b = browserify(entry, b_opts)\n    .transform(some_xform);\n\n  b.bundle()\n    .pipe(vss('bundle.js'))\n    // ...\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(dest));\n});\n```\n",

E.g.:\n\n``` js\nbrowserify('./src/index.js')\n  .transform(whatever)\n  .bundle()\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./build/whatever.js'));\n```\n- This only allows you to `gulp.src()` one entry file per bundle, right?\n- You're not even using globbing.\n- This only allows you to apply gulp plugins to that one file or the whole bundle output.\n- Without additional effort doesn't this name the bundle after the single entry file?\n",

    "body": "@jmm I _am_ using globbing and have multiple bundles for different parts of sites I build typically.. I have different file names for each bundle...  The browserify+fs way doesn't handle globs by default like gulp does.  I use globs to select the various bundles I need.  I also typically `require()` in-file, since different files may have different dependencies, not every single bundle has the same needs. In addition, with the gulp flow, I'll get to apply various other plugins (uglify, rename, whatever) to each file individually...\n\nMy structure is usually like this when it comes to stuff I want to browserify for bigger builds that have different bundles...\n\n```\n/src\n  /libs\n  /models\n  /etc...\n  bundle1.js\n  bundle2.js\n  bundle3.js\n    ...etc...\n/public\n  /js \n...etc...\n```\n\nTask ends up looking like this:\n\n``` js\ngulp.src(\"./src/*.js\")\n   .pipe(<browserify through2 style>)\n   .pipe(uglify())\n   .pipe(rename({extname: \".min.js\"}) // if we're doing production, for example\n   .pipe(gulp.dest(\"./public/js\"))\n;\n```\n\nI'll get my individual bundles this way.  I also would prefer to have my tasks all gulp-y since I use gulp for a lot of other things (less compile, hint/linting, etc.).  I have the browserify task built out in another file that I just require in my gulp file, so I can essentially do `var browserify = require('./tasks/gulp-browserify.js');` and then the pipe would be as such: `.pipe(browserify())`.  (In gulp-browserify.js would be requiring through2 and browserify doing the solution @aymanrady posted.)\n",

In other words you get a separate bundle for each file that's globbed, right?\n\n> I also typically `require()` in-file, since different files may have different dependencies, not every single bundle has the same needs.\n\nSorry, I'm not sure what you mean here.\n\n> In addition, with the gulp flow, I'll get to apply various other plugins (uglify, rename, whatever) to each file individually...\n\nTo each entry file or bundle file, right?\n\nIf it works for you I guess it's better than using vinyl-transform, which I believe only ever accidentally worked the way you guys were using it.\n",

    "body": "@aymanrady @clineamb Thanks for the feedback and sorry for the delayed reply. Your participation in the discussion is helpful for understanding what people are doing and why and identifying the pros and cons of various techniques. This thread is a good opportunity to hash out what works and what doesn't, which ideas are keepers and which aren't. The vinyl-transform one (at least the original incarnation @burmisov posted about) is clearly not, as it misapplies vinyl-transform and results in the problem discussed here.\n\n@aymanrady\n\n> you can create a bundle from multiple entries, here is a rudimentary example on how to achieve that\n\nYes, thanks for the additional example. You can of course adapt it to do more at the expense of more code / greater complexity. By the time you're going to as much trouble as your latest example to get globbing via `gulp.src()`, it's worth considering just bypassing gulp for the globbing, like:\n\n``` js\ngulp.task('default', function (cb) {\n  var\n    glob = require('glob'),\n    b = browserify();\n\n  // If desired, can apply transforms to entry file(s) and deps\n  b.transform(whatever);\n\n  // If you want multiple entry files => single bundle. Move some logic from\n  // `end` to `match` if you want a bundle for each entry file.\n  (new glob.Glob('./src/js/**/*.js'))\n    .on('match', function (filename) {\n      // add each file to the bundle\n      b.add(filename);\n    })\n    .on('end', function () {\n      b.bundle()\n        // Name bundle whatever you want here\n        .pipe(vss('bundle.js'))\n        // single bundle file\n        // apply minification or/and whatever bundle file here\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/js').on('finish', cb));\n    });\n});\n```\n\n> multiple entry files going to bundler\n> you can apply jslint, jsbeautify on src files here\n\nIs it common that you'd want to apply those things to just your entry file(s) and not the files in the dependency graph?\n\nHere is a variation on yours that does use `gulp.src()`, but eschews manually creating a vinyl object in favor of vinyl-source-stream:\n\n``` js\ngulp.task('default', function (cb) {\n  var\n    through2 = require('through2'),\n    b = browserify();\n\n  b.transform(whatever);\n\n  gulp.src('src/js/**/*.js')\n    // multiple entry files going to bundler\n    // you can apply jslint, jsbeautify on src files here\n    .pipe(through2.obj(\n      function write (file, enc, next) {\n        b.add(file.path);\n        next();\n      },\n      function end (next) {\n        b.bundle()\n          .pipe(vss('bundle.js'))\n          .pipe(gulp.dest('build/js').on('finish', cb));\n\n        next();\n      }\n    ));\n});\n```\n\n@clineamb\n\n> To first point about in-file, I don't typically require() files programmatically (browserify().require() or .add()) in a .js file it looks like a node.js file setup:\n\nI think what you're saying is that you typically only have 1 entry file per bundle, right?\n\n> As for applying other gulp plugins, it's usually post-browserify-bundling.\n\nOk, so it sounds like the pivotal issue for you is being able to do globbing to select 1 entry file per bundle.\n\n> I actually find the through2 way much cleaner than the vinyl-transform way that broke. I've also found the through2 way to be more forward compatible with versions of browserify that have come out (I did some tests on versions from 7 - 8+).\n\nThe vinyl-transform way may never have been a good fit, but it certainly isn't now.\n",

    "body": "@pikeas \n\n> Would really like to use browserify + vinyl-transform. Is this a browserify bug or a wontfix?\n\nIt's not a browserify bug. `browserify().bundle()` is documented as returning a _readable_ stream. vinyl-transform is for wrapping a _transform_ stream. While `bundle()` may technically return a writable stream, it's not intended to be written to from outside of browserify (and that's not even how the vinyl-transform technique works when it does work).\n\nFor the time being I recommend you take a look at the various techniques suggested in this thread (by others and myself) and see if one of them works for you. If not, please post more information about your situation. vinyl-transform is not a good fit for this no matter what, but if you're really intent on using it for some reason it may work by re-arranging your code as discussed in one of my earlier posts.\n",

    "body": "This issue is due to use of vinyl-transform in a way that doesn't make sense. Please note that I'm not pointing fingers at anyone for doing it, I know everyone is just trying to figure out how to integrate browserify with gulp and that's one of the techniques that's been promoted. But it was a poor choice of technique that only worked as a fluke.\n\nFor that reason I'm closing the issue. However, for the time being we can continue to use this thread to discuss ways of integrating them that _do_ make sense.\n\nAlso note that as of browserify v9.0.5 / v9.0.6 use of vinyl-transform in any variation discussed in this thread will fail 100% of the time, I believe.

Yesterday I posted a [comment](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1044#issuecomment-88980045) with two code examples for using multiple entry files. One was a variation on @aymanrady's suggestion to put a through stream in the middle of `gulp.src()` where I eliminated manually constructing a vinyl object in favor of using vinyl-source-stream. The other was an example of not using `gulp.src()` or a through stream. It's similar to what you just posted except it doesn't use a through stream at all, has a more linear relationship between source code order and event order, and I chose to illustrate calling `b.add()` for each match instead of waiting for all matches and passing them to `browserify()`.\n",

I wanted it to be taken as another alternative to vinyl-transform that worked with multiple input files, addressing my cliff ending \"globby.sync\" comment I made as I was trying to rush out an answer so I could get to work.\n\nPlease accept my apologies.\n",

    "body": "@terinjokes, thanks for the logic regarding constructing a bundle with multiple entries. Unfortunately, I'm also having an issue when I try to add a `require('./relative-path-to-filename')` in one of those entries. I'll get a console error stating that it cannot find that module. I'll look at the compilation, and the local file(s) that I wanted to require are `undefined` as seen below. What am I doing incorrectly?\n\n![screen shot 2015-05-18 at 3 17 56 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1504302/7688233/1fa291a2-fd71-11e4-892b-d83a2fbb8860.png)\n",
