    "body": "@thlorenz that is a good method of doing this, hadn't considered that. \n\nI still don't see an easy way of using this to disable module level transforms from other plugins that bundle using browserify (such as grunt-browserify or karma-browserify). Any suggestions on how to do that?\n\nI suppose another concern would be that you are relying on the `package.json` file for this to happen. Perhaps I want to use different options in two different configs for grunt-browserify, I couldn't do this since my transform would just look to the same `package.json` for each.\n\nAlso, just to clarify, `browserify-shim` doesn't actually make any of the \"options\" stuff possible, it's just an example of a transform that gets its options from `package.json`.\n",

    "body": "@colinkahn I'm not sure why you would want to disable transforms. Either they are needed or not.\n\nIf you actually publish the generated code and therefore want to disable when you publish, I'd suggest using cli flags to specify these transforms while you are working on the module.\n\nCurrent transforms have this simple signature: `function ({String} file) -> {TransformStream}`. This makes them highly compatible with other tools like [catw](https://github.com/substack/catw) and [mutiny](https://github.com/thlorenz/mutiny).\nChanging that signature to allow options to be passed to a transform would undo this great compatibility\n\nWRT grunt-browserify and other grunt tools. Since they decided to repeat all config options in the `Gruntfile`, which makes them inaccessible to other tools you will run into these kind of problems with them.\nAdding options to the `package.json` is a common standard (`node`, `npm`, `browserify`, etc.) do it this way. It makes it easy for everyone to find and consume them.\nSo the fact that options are in the `package.json` is not the problem, but the fact that `grunt` decided to do things its own way actually is.\n\nThis shows with other tools as well, i.e. when adding `jshint` options to the `Gruntfile` while all other tools are looking for it in your `.jshintrc` in your project dir.\n",

    "body": "@thlorenz for the use case of wanting to disable module level transforms lets say I have several components all as CommonJS npm modules, and each of those uses coffeescript. Currently browserify (and correct me if I'm wrong) requires me to add `coffeeify` as a module level transform so when I require in those modules into a parent project they can be correctly transformed. But now I want to also add code coverage for my coffee files using [Ibrik](https://github.com/HBOCodeLabs/ibrik). When I add the coverage using Ibrik it will convert my coffee files to JS, so I no longer need to use the coffeeify transform. Unfortunately there is no way for me to stop browserify from applying the module level transform and I get an error as coffeeify attempts to parse `.coffee` files that are actually at this point javascript. My current line of thinking involved making my own coffeeify transform where I could set an option whether to add the Ibrik coverage or not. This still wouldn't be possible using the `package.json` example though since I only get one chance to configure how I want that transform to work.\n\nWhat is difficult about this situation is that I need to include coffeeify in my `package.json` but I have no way to actually disable or override it. Like I mentioned, exposing a `transformKey` option through the api would let me disable all module transforms, but I don't think that's the best answer.\n\nAs far as the current way transforms are handled, while the simplicity of them might make them reusable in different scenarios, in use I feel like I'm not getting as much out of them as I want. In a single project I could want to perform various transforms to my code for development vs. production vs. testing.\n",

As soon as you need to configure the transform conditionally (lets say a different config for testing vs. production), then storing that config in a static file becomes a problem.\n\nThe way I see it you have:\n- Everything in `package.json` is what you want to use when the module is consumed, IE required into a project\n- Those settings in `package.json` should be allowed to be overridden or ignored so you can use different options when in development or testing etc\n\nSo if you were to use the browserify api (like tools such as grunt-browserify and karma-browserify make use of) you could do something like:\n\n```\nvar options = { ignoreModuleTranforms: true },\n    b = browerify(options);\n\nb.transform(\"transformify\", {someOption: true})\n```\n\nBrowserify could pass those options onto module deps and could then do something simple like execute the transform using the context of the options object passed into it, so you could then have a transform like:\n\n```\nfunction transformify(file) {\n  if (this.someOption) {\n\n  }\n}\n```\n",

    "body": "@thlorenz yeah I think at this point I'm leaning away from formatting the transform field differently. I could see an almost workable version of this using the suggestions so far:\n1. Transforms include an optional \"makeTransform\" function that will return the transform function with options set in a closure (used when adding the transform through the api)\n2. If an option isn't set then the transform will look to it's parent `package.json` file for that option\n\nThen all you'd need to add is some way to optionally ignore the transforms in `package.json` if you are doing something where the transforms you're setting through the api could conflict. That could be as simple as another option when you instantiate browerify or even an environment variable like `BROWSERIFY_IGNORE_PACKAGE_TRANSFORMS`.\n",

Again I think the approach taken with `browserify-shim` is pretty simple for that.\nIt wouldn't have to resolve config from `package.json` either, but could look for any other config file named by convention, i.e. `.ngtemplatefyrc`.\n",

    "body": "@thlorenz yeah `package.json` would always be what is used when transforming a dependency, but having the convention where you use a `makeTransform` function to override the `package.json` options would give you complete control when using the api. And then yeah, you could set it up to use a different file to, if you had a reason not to use `package.json` for some reason. That would all be left to the transform developer. \n\nI still see the need though to allow shutting off transforms defined in `package.json`, otherwise you cannot uniquely configure a bundle using just the browserify api (since it will go back and just run the transforms in `package.json` at the end).\n",

    "body": "While we're on the subject of transform reform, I notice that there are many transforms based on Falafel.  If you have a bunch of these in your transform chain, then for each js file in your project, you end up reparsing the same file with Falafel over and over again.  It seems like there must be a more efficient way to do this.  It's tempting to write a \"falafelify\" transform that loads up a bunch of other transforms and runs them on every node, except how would I configure the transform list?

    "body": "@thlorenz excited to hear this! My question is, in application, lets say I have a project that uses several modules, all with `config-transform` in their `package.json`. When I browserify the project, I wouldn't necessarily want the other modules that use `config-transform` to also pick up on the environment variable, since that could compile them in some unwanted way. Instead I'd want them to behave much like transforms do now for modules, using their `module` level transform. Get what I mean? So even though I'm developing on my project, I want the modules to be transformed in some consistent manner when they're required in. Perhaps something like a `module` key would be possible:\n\n```\n{ \n\"browserify\": {\n  \"transform\": [ \"some transform that applies in all envs\", \"config-transform\" ]\n},\n\"config-transform\": {\n  \"module\": [\"when this module is required, use this transform\"],\n  \"prod\": [ \"transform to run in prod only\" ],\n  \"dev\": [ \"requirefy\" ],\n  \"test\": [ \"test-inject\" ]\n}\n}\n```\n\nJust a suggestion, but then you'd be able to really pinpoint the behavior when you're using a lot of different components.\n",

In most cases none of the names will be present and only the transforms in the `browserify.transform` field will be used. The `config-transform` however in that case will find no matching config and just pass the content through.\n",
