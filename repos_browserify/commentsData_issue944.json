    "body": "This is related to #942, but it does not seem possible right now. Ultimately the goal is to provide a tool (or Browserify plugin) for optimizing bundle size by splitting out and compressing images/CSS/JSON/etc. But I can't do that unless I have full control over the pipeline (i.e. overriding transforms on all modules rather than top-level).\n\nI'd be happy to submit a PR. Maybe a `transformOverride` option for module-deps?\n\n``` js\nbrowserify({\n    transformOverride: function(tr) {\n        if (tr === 'myfunc') return myOverrideFunc\n        else return tr\n    }\n})\n```\n\nAlternatively, the transforms could be ignored during the module-dep step, and then transformed after the fact with a global transform:\n\n``` js\nbrowserify({\n    //will not invoke this transform on any module-deps\n    transformIgnores: [ 'myfunc' ] \n}).plugin( myOverrideFunc ).bundle()\n```\n",

    "body": "I'd love to have more control from the plugins as well, especially some control for before the pipeline is created. For a plugin I'm writing I need to override several (default) options that are passed to the pipeline, but I cannot do that at the moment. At best I can override pipeline stages completely, but this requires to duplicate a lot of code from this project and is therefore very likely to break on updates. \n\nWithout this control I have the choice to either create a (non-plugin) module that wraps browserify entirely, or I'll have to require the user to set a bunch of options manually. Both are far from ideal, especially for CLI usage.\n\nFor me just a `transformOverride` method won't help at all, and I also think it's not the way to go since it only solves one particular instance of this problem, instead of tackling the problem at its root.\n\nA possible solution that would allow pretty much full control would be to let plugins define a `before` and `after` function, where the `after` function would be the same as what now the entire plugin is, and the `before` function is called just after the options has been set. This allows any plugin developer to override anything before Browserify starts doing it's work. The API for this could simply look like this:\n\n``` javascript\nbrowserify()\n    .plugin({\n        before : function(b, opts) { },\n        after : function(b, opts) { }\n    });\n```\n\nWhen a function instead of an object is passed to the plugin function it could be considered to be the `after` function to preserve full backwards compatibility. \n\nI'd be happy to provide a PR for this if there is interest in this.\n",
