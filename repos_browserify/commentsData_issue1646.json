    "body": "No, Browserify does not support `Vinyl` instances. The fact it worked before was incidental, and it seems the developers decided they didn't want to continue supporting that implementation.\n\nAs you can see from the code, browserify expects a string for the file path or a `Stream` as inputs to the `require` method. You should either not create Vinyl files (if you're creating them, as in the example) and pass the file path or extract the `contents` property. If the latter, make sure to also pass in [`opts.file`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/blob/10b93d8e27be696655beaf7cda57c81c96f95367/index.js#L135).\n",
