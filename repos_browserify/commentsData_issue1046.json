    "body": "I don't think this is such a good idea because the browser field's job is just to provide mappings for browser-specific packages in a local package. The proposed changes would break that expectation of locality: importing a package could change the behavior of module resolution in far-reaching ways.\n\nWith this feature it would be much easier for packages to conflict. Normally, multiple versions of a package can live in the dependency graph without any problems. If different versions of the same package or multiple packages try to elevate themselves, it will create strange race conditions or conflicts that will be very hard to debug.\n\nFinally, these changes introduce some order-dependence that we don't currently have because the browser field is resolved at runtime as each library is individually loaded and its package.json is checked. If libraries could expose themselves to a global scope, that would introduce order-dependence in resolution because exposing a package mutates the behavior of the lookup algorithm. Just like the stacking of script tags that browserify attempts to get away from.\n",

If there was a way to identify a global to pass in from the script identified in the browser field, it would make the task of adding support to packages vastly easier.\n",
