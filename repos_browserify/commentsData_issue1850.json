    "body": "\"b\" should depend directly on all the transforms it uses in the transform key.\r\n\r\nThe transform key is intended for things that have to be done to a package at bundle time. However Babel should be run before publish 99% of the time. Chances are that a package that specifies babelify in the transform key means to configure babel in their _own_ build process, to generate a UMD bundle or something, not in the build process of the consumer. So, ideally package \"b\" would not have that transform key at all and instead use the browserify command line flags or the Node API to generate its UMD bundle, and ship compiled ES5 code in the npm package.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense!",

    "body": "Yes that's what I though, just wanted to be sure because this package.json thingy is new to me although I'm working with browserify for a long time. The example in the docs using brfs makes sense, but babelify as you say doesn't and is probably as you say - just removing he property will solve the problem. \r\n\r\nWould a PR adding a paragraph [here](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-handbook#packagejson) regarding this be accepted ? \r\n\r\nThank you very much",
