    "body": "Hello @TimDaub \n\n> So since both react-router-bootstrap and react-bootstrap could (and maybe do) use the same version of classnames.js, I'm wondering why they're not bundled as one dependency.\n\nPlease see [saving bytes](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#saving-bytes) in the handbook:\n\n> browserify will not include the same exact file twice, but compatible versions may differ slightly. browserify is also not version-aware, it will include the versions of packages exactly as they are laid out in `node_modules/` according to the `require()` algorithm that node uses.\n\nbrowserify is not going to figure out if they're supposed to be compatible. I think it is meant to dedupe them if the files are identical. Are any of the files you referenced identical? If not I suggest you `$ npm dedupe` and try bundling again.\n",
