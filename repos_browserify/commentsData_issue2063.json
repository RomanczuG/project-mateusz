    "body": "If something works with npm, and not with an alternative package manager, then it seems likely to be a bug in that package manager. If pnpm, or yarn, or anyone else is placing things in a different location than npm does, then it's responsible for also ensuring that standard module resolution APIs act as if things are in an npm-installed location.\r\n\r\nHave you filed an issue on pnpm to investigate? If there's something in browserify then a fix ofc can be investigated, but it seems worth checking with pnpm first.",

    "body": "Hi @ljharb, thanks for mentioning it! About opening it on `pnpm`, from what I read yesterday, when an issue is tooling related, it's something that `pnpm` wont solve, according to this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/801\r\n\r\nAlso, we had a similar issue in the past which was open there and solved in `browserify/module-deps`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/795\r\nhttps://github.com/browserify/module-deps/pull/133\r\n\r\nI ended up deciding to open it here because I saw an issue that involved the same package (`is-buffer`), which was solved in `browserify/insert-module-globals`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/browserify/browserify/issues/1825.\r\nhttps://github.com/browserify/insert-module-globals/pull/75.\r\n\r\nAlso, since it has something to do with patching `Buffer.isBuffer` (which seems to be browserify's responsibility) I thought this would be the right place.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to add, if I change the call in `browserify/insert-module-globals` from `path.relative` to `path.resolve`, it ends up bundling things correctly:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/index.js b/index.js\r\nindex dfc2664..3c35f03 100644\r\n--- a/index.js\r\n+++ b/index.js\r\n@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ var isbufferPath = require.resolve('is-buffer')\r\n var combineSourceMap = require('combine-source-map');\r\n \r\n function getRelativeRequirePath(fullPath, fromPath) {\r\n-  var relpath = path.relative(path.dirname(fromPath), fullPath);\r\n+  var relpath = path.resolve(path.dirname(fromPath), fullPath);\r\n   // If fullPath is in the same directory or a subdirectory of fromPath,\r\n   // relpath will result in something like \"index.js\", \"src/abc.js\".\r\n   // require() needs \"./\" prepended to these paths.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there's one test that ends up failing because of this: https://github.com/browserify/insert-module-globals/blob/0549e4372523ec2c967058b0bfce51fad9038b0f/test/isbuffer.js#L22.",
