    "body": "This seems to have included a bug with using relative symlink in `node_modules`.\n\nfor instance, I have a 3 modules in this structure:\n\n```\n/common/\n/mobile/\n/desktop/\n```\n\nI want a \"common\" module and to be able to do `require(\"common/foo\")` from any of mobile and desktop projects, so my way was using a `\"/node_modules/common\"` which points to `\"../../common\"` in both projects _(and eventually instrumented with `grunt-contrib-symlink`)_. It worked so far before this commit.\n\nAny workaround? What the standard way of doing this?\n\nThanks\n",

    "body": "@gre It's probably bad form to depend on a package outside of your package's root directory that isn't listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file. That being said, this probably should work, so we should look into why it's not.\n\nThe way that I do this, which does work under this patch, is to make all of your modules complete stand-alone installable packages. Then when installing them, I use something like `nodeenv` and `npm install --link` to ensure that you don't have multiple copies running around if you happen to already have them installed elsewhere.\n",
