    "body": "> For example, I want to tell my friend \"Hey, this is my package. Install it, then use it with browserify\" without having to also say \"Oh yeah, also make sure you add this fooify transform to your package.json browserify.transform array and your dependencies\".\n\nThis is exactly how browserify transforms work. Each package specifies its transforms and they only apply locally.\n\nThe real issue is with famous encouraging users to use `require` incorrectly. Why do they say `require('./core/Context.js')` for example, when the correct path is `require('./src/core/Context.js')`? Try the latter in your own code and it'll work just fine.\n\nIf you want their weird `require` magic (which automatically adds `src/` for you) to work _in your own module_, then you need to add their `famousify` transform _to your own module_.\n\nThey should just axe their `src/` folder and move everything to the top level and get rid of that silly transform entirely. Why do people love to make simple things complicated?\n",
