After digging around some more in the utils.js file, it looks like I can get this to work if I make the value of the `transformations` property something like this: `{transformation: ['w960_transparent']`. Not clear at all from the documentation.\n\nAnd speaking of the documentation, this node.js example for `download_archive_url` is misleading: `cloudinary.utils.download_archive_url(options, callback);`. That callback parameter doesn't exist in the code.\n",

    "body": "@taragano , thanks for the reply and for fixing the `callback` param issue.\n\nYou're right that the documentation for `cloudinary.image` refers to `transformation`. But the documentation for the [\"Generate Archive\" methods](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#generate_archive) refers to `transformations` with an \"s.\" And it doesn't explain why the options for `cloudinary.download_zip_url`, for example, would have to look like this (with `transformation` as a sub-property of `transformations`):\n\n``` js\n{\n  transformations: {\n    transformation: []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe description of the `transformations` option wrongly states that it takes an array, rather than an object: \n\n> This parameter is given as an array (using the SDKs) or comma-separated list (for direct API calls) of transformations, and separated with a slash for chained transformations.\n\nAnd the following sentence is ambiguous at best:\n\n> Note that when using the SDK for a dynamically-typed language, the transformation parameters can be specified directly without using the transformation parameter. \n\nThanks again for your help.\n",

    "body": "@kswedberg, that's correct, the generate archive supports generating a ZIP file that includes multiple `transformations` (that's why the \"s\" is there), and it gets an array of hashes, where each hash includes the parameters of the transformations. \nHere's one other example, the following will generate 2 different transformed images for each included original image:\n\n```\n{\n  transformations: [\n    {\n      width: 200,\n      crop: \"scale\"\n    },\n    {\n      width: 400,\n      crop: \"scale\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo differentiate named transformations with dynamic ones, the `transformation` parameter is used, which tells Cloudinary that the value is a named transformation.\nSo it should actually look like:\n\n```\n{\n  transformations: [\n    {\n      transformation: \"my_named_transformation\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYour version is just a \"shortcut\" of this one :)\nI hope this helps.\n",
