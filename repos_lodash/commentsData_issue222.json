    "body": "For whatever it may be worth, personally I find the style of `{ 'leading': true }` to be more intuitive of the options you've given, @jdalton . One could of course support both object-argument options.\n\nAnother alternative, if you aren't set on the options argument is having a parameter for each edge of `throttle` i.e.\n\n``` javascript\n_.throttle(func, wait, onLeading, onTrailing);\n```\n\nThis has the advantages of:\n1. No need for `lodash` to inspect an object to determine the options;\n2. More errors ought to occur at compilation, instead of having run-time errors when the argument is invalid;\n3. There's no risk of spelling errors - the most likely error ... `Ieading` != `leading` != `lead`. \n4. Quite easy to remember – the leading option comes before the trailing one.\n\nThe only disadvantage would seem to be that the arguments cannot be dynamically created trivially. However one could still use [_.partialRight](http://lodash.com/docs#partialRight) e.g. `doubleEdgeThrottle = _.partialRight(_.throttle, true, true)`, and arguably this is more elegant (IMHO).\n\nAll that being said, it's just food for thought and I completely defer to your preference! :)\n",

    "body": "That's a great article - the _Boolean Trap_, thanks @jdalton. Thanks for the decision, too - and I remain totally fine with either boolean or object arguments.\n\n---\n\nFor passers-by and reflection I think it's worth spelling out why the excellent article on the boolean trap suggests avoiding boolean-only arguments:\n1. Boolean arguments are not extensible - if future options come up, then one cannot add them;\n2. Boolean arguments can be confusing, ambiguous and in any case unclear until one looks at the documentation.\n\nOn point 1, the `_.throttle` is a fairly standard and concise function. I am not sure what other options there could be  beyond leading/trailing edge. I suppose one could have a stochastic or programmatically determined length of delay for the throttle (e.g. exponentially increasing wait-time for when a network resource is overloaded, but then one would want to really overload the `wait` argument), but maybe that's beyond normal use and expectations for a canonical throttle function. Who knows though, right?\n\nOn point 2, the concern advocated in the _Boolean Trap_ article relates to ambiguous arguments where one is forced guess their purpose or look them up in the documentation. For example  it is unclear what `volumeSlider.setValue(90, false);` is without looking at the documentation. It would be much clearer to have `volumeSlider.setValue(90, { animation: false } );`, and I generally agree that this is helpful. I do note that most of the options discussed in the _Boolean Trap_ typically relate to optional side-effects (e.g. 'animate') or arbitrary parameters (eg 'caseSensitive', 'exactMatch' and 'highlightMatchedLine' where they are all interchangeable).\n\nIn the case of throttle, perhaps it is peculiarly clear what the arguments do because of the meaning of the arguments is a reflection of their order. As well, boolean arguments to `_.throttle` are not related to optional side-effects (e.g. `animate`), or arbitrary parameters but are the core yet entire range of parameters for the function. Plus, I think the boolean options are decidedly memorable ... but then, I suggested them, so I am a decidedly poor sample.\n\nAlthough my first thought was that boolean arguments are preferable for the reasons above, there is merit to an object argument, and it was useful to read the _Boolean Trap_. I'm not advocating one side or the other in this case, but I thought it would be worthwhile to spell out the boolean trap for anyone else reflecting on this. I don't think either boolean or object-argument is a bad choice here, though in general I agree that one should be wary of the boolean trap.\n\nWith either option, one of course could always have a backwards-compatible `_.throttle` by testing the argument types with e.g. `_.isBoolean` / `_.isObject`.\n",
