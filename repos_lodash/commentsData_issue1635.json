    "body": "The thing is that `_.filter` method is an instrument to work mainly with Collections of objects. That is why when you pass String as a second argument it is not comparing each element with it, but trying to read properties with such name on each element and take only those how are truly\n\nFor example this\n\n```\nvar arr = [{a: 1}, {a: 0}];\nalert(_.filter(arr, \"a\").length);\n```\n\nwill alert 1.\n\nYour problem could be solved, for example, like this\n\n```\nvar arr = [\"1\", \"1\"];\nalert(_.filter(arr, _.eq.bind(_, \"1\")).length);\n```\n",
