    "body": "@floydsoft \n\n> So what's the core philosophy on Lo-Dash? Making it different from Underscore.\n\nJeremy [wrote](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/issues/376#issuecomment-2815538):\n\n> The original idea with Underscore was to take the common set of useful data-manipulation primitives that you often need when working on a large JS application, and implement them in the fastest, smallest, and least invasive way possible -- so that if you need to just throw in Underscore into an existing application or web page to use a helper or two, it's never a problem to do so.\n\nUnfortunately, Underscore has core design flaws that [prevent it](https://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/205057023031779328) from being a simple drop-in utility and has since taken the stance to [no longer concern itself with cross-browser consistency](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/commit/4e4bc194c0a0e06aa8f7633695ad10030d871a2b) and [close issues](https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash#closed-underscorejs-issues) or [revert patches](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/commit/9e4192729375c8eab68913d36de9fbb8ffbbdfcc) instead of fixing [real bugs](http://twitter.com/#!/kangax/status/141314165141803008).\n\nAs browsers progress the need for a lot of this API sugar will disappear because developers in ES5 compatible environments will use more native methods. So Underscore's BIG draw should be that it provides these features for older browsers in a consistent and cross-browser way. Its punt on consistency defeats a big reason to use it.\n\nI started Lo-Dash with a focus on performance, consistency (in API and usage), and customizability. I wanted to show that it's possible to fix real issues like object iteration bugs in IE, Firefox, Opera, and Safari without sacrificing performance or adding mass bloat. I've taken it up a notch by providing custom builds, better documentation, and more debug helpers too.\n",
