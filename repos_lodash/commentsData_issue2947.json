    "body": "@jdalton \r\n\r\nSorry this is my first time really doing any kind of performance re-write like this...or diving into source code for that matter; I also apologize for this not being really where I should have reopened an issue. I just figured for continuity of the question asked it was best asked here.\r\n\r\nI first swapped out, I guess you would call it _modules_, and went with:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport throttle from 'lodash-es/throttle';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis led to about a 100kb reduction, a good start.\r\n\r\n I then looked at the `babel-plugin-lodash` and for starters am just running it in `development` mode in my `.babelrc`:\r\n\r\n```rc\r\n{\r\n  \"env\": {\r\n    \"development\": {\r\n      \"presets\": [\"env\", [\"es2015\", {\"modules\": false}], \"react\", \"stage-0\"],\r\n      \"plugins\": [\r\n        \"lodash\",\r\n        \"transform-class-properties\",\r\n        \"react-hot-loader/babel\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"production\": {\r\n      \"presets\": [[\"es2015\", {\"modules\": false}], \"react\", \"stage-0\"]\r\n    },\r\n    \"test\": {\r\n      \"presets\": [\"env\", [\"es2015\", {\"modules\": false}], \"react\", \"stage-0\"],\r\n      \"plugins\": [\"istanbul\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMy question for the plugin refers to the _optionsObject_:\r\n```rc\r\n [\"lodash\", { \"id\": \"lodash-es\", cwd: \"???\" }],\r\n```\r\nI'm a little unsure what is required in the _current working directory_ key. Is that possibly the location of the lodash method being used in my code, or is that the path to `lodash-es`? The name being `cwd` I feel the latter is probably not right.\r\n\r\nMy other question is about `lodash-webpack-plugin`:\r\n\r\nI looked at the _mapping.js_ file to see what the feature would be for _throttle_ and did not find it so I originally just went with using `\"lodash\"` in the `.babelrc` & using `new LodashModuleReplacementPlugin(),` in my `webpack.dev.config.js`. I was meet with about a 24kb reduction in `lodash@4.17.4` (I used `webpack-dashboard` to get a break down of the modules):\r\n\r\n_webpack.dev.config.js_\r\n```javascript \r\nrequire('dotenv-safe').load();\r\n\r\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\r\nconst path = require('path');\r\nconst ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin');\r\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\r\nconst DashboardPlugin = require('webpack-dashboard/plugin');\r\nconst LodashModuleReplacementPlugin = require('lodash-webpack-plugin');\r\n\r\nconst VENDOR_LIBS = [\r\n  'axios', 'lodash-es', 'react', 'react-dom', 'react-redux',\r\n  'react-redux-multilingual', 'react-redux-toastr', 'react-router',\r\n  'react-router-redux', 'redux', 'redux-auth-wrapper',\r\n  'redux-form', 'redux-pack', 'redux-promise-middleware',\r\n  'semantic-ui-react'\r\n];\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  entry: {\r\n    bundle: [\r\n      'babel-polyfill',\r\n      'react-hot-loader/patch',\r\n      'webpack-dev-server/client?http://localhost:9000',\r\n      'webpack/hot/only-dev-server',\r\n      './client/index.js'\r\n    ],\r\n    vendor: VENDOR_LIBS,\r\n  },\r\n  output: {\r\n    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\r\n    filename: '[name].js',\r\n    publicPath: '/'\r\n  },\r\n  module: {\r\n    rules: [\r\n      {\r\n        use: 'babel-loader',\r\n        test: /\\.js$/,\r\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract({\r\n          loader: 'css-loader'\r\n        }),\r\n        test: /\\.css$/\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  performance: {\r\n    hints: false\r\n  },\r\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map',\r\n  devServer: {\r\n    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\r\n    compress: true,\r\n    port: 9000,\r\n    hot: true,\r\n    inline: true,\r\n    historyApiFallback: true,\r\n    open: true,\r\n    quiet: true,\r\n    proxy: {\r\n      '/api': 'http://localhost:3000'\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new LodashModuleReplacementPlugin(),\r\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\r\n      'process.env': {\r\n        NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),\r\n        CLOUD_NAME: JSON.stringify(process.env.CLOUD_NAME),\r\n        UPLOAD_PRESET: JSON.stringify(process.env.UPLOAD_PRESET),\r\n      }\r\n    }),\r\n    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({\r\n      names: ['vendor', 'manifest']\r\n    }),\r\n    new DashboardPlugin(),\r\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\r\n      template: 'public/index.html'\r\n    }),\r\n    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),\r\n    new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin(),\r\n    new ExtractTextPlugin('style.css'),\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do get an interesting error message when adding `new LodashModuleReplacementPlugin(),`:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-01-24 at 11 20 21 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19720404/22278860/314da926-e28c-11e6-8746-04ceb13d2df6.png)\r\n\r\nIt's only when this new instance is declared that the error appears; but it seems to be breaking something in my store (probably the _throttle_) and thus causes any `connect()` components to fail with this error message. However when I looked at the source code for the `lodash-es/throttle` method I did not see anything referring to an _iteratee_ that could some how be getting passed as a prop. It very well could correlate as well to not passing the `cwd` key in the `.babelrc`.\r\n\r\nAny guidance or explanation to my questions would be greatly appreciated. The error could likely be conflict with different techs and I will have to dive in to find that fix. Thanks!",

    "body": "Hi @rockchalkwushock !\r\n\r\nYou only need to specify an \"id\" in the `babel-plugin-lodash` options if you're using more than 1 lodash module. By default the plugin will sniff out which one you're using. The \"cwd\" option is used to set the directory where lodash modules [are looked for](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash/issues/56). You won't likely need to set that either because by default it sniffs out the `node_modules` folder.\r\n\r\nThe `lodash-webpack-plugin` issue you're seeing is because by default the plugin disables iteratee shorthands. To enable that feature set you'll want to set its `'shorthands': true` option. But that comes at a file size cost as \"shorthands\" support is expensive by bytes.",
