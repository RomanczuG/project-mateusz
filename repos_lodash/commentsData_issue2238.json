    "body": "Thanks for your quick reply!\n\nI agree consistency and simplicity are important, but I'd opt for keeping the `key|index` here, especially since the `key` within objects can contain relevant information about an object. For the use-case I defined above this does not make things more simple. Also, consistency across \"By\" methods doesn't hold for the `pickBy` function and for instance the more regular `map` and `mapValues` functions.\n\nOf course, I only see things from my perspective here, but for me this change does not make things simpler.\n",
