    "body": "@anyanyan07 is correct here. `length` is the most reliable way to determine if something is array like. `Arguments` for example is array like, however, it only has a `length` key and no higher order functions like map, or reduce.\r\n\r\nThe `lodash.reduce` method actually uses the [`lodash.isArrayLike`](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/isArrayLike.js) method, which is where your specific problem is occurring.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this isn't a common issue, but it is very annoying for you. As a work-around, you could write your own reduce method to handle objects in just a few lines of code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction reduceObject(collection, iterator, accumulator) {\r\n  for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(collection)) {\r\n    accumulator = iterator(accumulator, value, key, collection)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return accumulator\r\n}\r\n\r\nreduceObject({a: 1, length: 3}, function(memo, v, k) {\r\n  return Object.assign(memo, {[k]: v})\r\n}, {})\r\n// {a: 1, length: 3}\r\n```",
