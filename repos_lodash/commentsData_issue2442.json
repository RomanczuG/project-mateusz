    "body": "Hi @danijar!\n\nThe method does the same thing as the native `reverse` (https://mdn.io/reverse), which also mutates the array. Since it follows the behavior of the native method, I would argue the opposite and say it is what most programmers would expect (or at least for the ones that use the native implementation). We don't usually differ from the native behavior, so I doubt we'll go with this.\n\nIf you want to create a new reversed array, you could use the native `slice` and call `reverse` on that one.\n",
