    "body": "In the simple case when we need just one property it is a combination of `pluck` and then `map` (as @d10 mentioned above). The issue's @id0Sch talking about makes sense if we need to transform _some property_ and return _whole object_, not a projection to that property. This is close to the idea of lenses. For instance `lensProp` works such:\n\n``` js\nâ†³ repl.js\njs > xL = util.lensProp('x');\n// xL is now a lens, functional getter-setter object\n{ [Function] set: [Function: f2], map: [Function: f2] }\n// lets use it as getter:\njs > [ {x:1}, {x:2} ].map(xL);\n[ 1, 2 ]\n// and then as setter:\njs > [ {x:1}, {x:2} ].map(xL.set(3));\n[ { x: 3 }, { x: 3 } ]\n```\n\nThis is clean and functional style. @id0Sch, maybe you want such stuff. However, I'm not sure it is suits for lodash and I'm also having some doubts about overhead of this approach. In major of production code this can be replaced with a combination of simpler functions. I'm not using this in my code.\n",
