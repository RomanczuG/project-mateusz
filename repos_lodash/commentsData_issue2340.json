This is needed _more often_ than deep-equal comparisons so is something a 'data library' should include. \r\n\r\nGauging popularity is simple. Just look at the _millions_ of users of the numerous shallow-equal npm packages. Many of these projects _also_ use Lodash, but must import an extra package to fill this 'hole' in an otherwise amazingly complete library. Personally, I usually add my own shallowEqual helper rather than import a package, but I'd rather not need to!",
