    "body": "That's true about `rearg: false` (which has the same effect as `_.flip`), but my point is that I'm using it a lot and I'd like to standardize the naming convention instead of converting all over the code base.\n\nIn practice I think this is something most fp users will end up needing. I understand if you don't want these non-rearged aliases in the core, so I can publish a separate library that just reargs some methods like a lodash/fp contrib sort of thing. Do you agree on the naming convention of appending 'From' for non-rearged methods? Even as a separate util I'd still like your buy in on the names.\n",
