    "body": "Hi @mvanlonden!\r\n\r\nTree-shaking is a bit of a lie. Tooling tends to be overly sensitive to potential side-effects, of which Lodash has none. I recommend using [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) *(it works for `lodash/fp` too)* and if you're feeling adventurous combo it with [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin) with the `\"currying\"` feature set enabled.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nWebpack 4 will support the [`sideEffects` field](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/next/examples/side-effects) which will allow for better tree-shaking support.",
