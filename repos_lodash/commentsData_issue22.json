    "body": "Specifying multiple filter object properties does a logical AND. For example, `{name: \"John\", age: 3}` says \"find all items which have both `name === \"John\"` AND `age === 3`.\" You could achieve the same result by chaining multiple `_.where` calls, eg.\n\n``` js\nvar littleJohn = _(people).chain().where({name: \"John\"}).where({age: 3}).value();\n```\n\nWhy not make the \"passing multiple keys\" option a logical OR in that case, where `{name: \"John\", age: 3}` would say \"find all items which have both `name === \"John\"` OR `age === 3`.\"\n\nOr is that unintuitive?\n",
