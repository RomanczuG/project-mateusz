In the case of an empty path your specifying selecting no properties from it so the result is `undefined`. In the transaction of \"give me the property of the object\" it doesn't make sense to ever say \"Naw, here's the object\", to which I'd say \"but I didn't want the object, I wanted a property of the object\".",
