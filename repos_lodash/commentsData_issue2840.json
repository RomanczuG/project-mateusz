You should be aware that getting symbols isn't cheap and will drag down the perf of any method that adds support. \r\n\r\nThat said, we support cloning objects with symbols with `_.clone` and `_.cloneDeep`.\r\nI just haven't added support for them in `_.isEqual`, yet. I'm not totally against it, though.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nPatched https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/fd4808147d762ba40299bc67b5ae3807f20d6145.\r\n",
