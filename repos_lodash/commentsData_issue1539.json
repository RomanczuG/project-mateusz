    "body": "Here's my current solution, which seems to produce as good results as possible in every case I've tried. In fact in nearly every case there will be 0 inexact results, unless your step is something like `1 / 3` (in which case the results are _still_ better than all other methods).\n\nWill post a PR later tonight. Could use some careful review:\n\n```\nfunction range(start, stop, step) {\n  var result = [];\n  var descend = stop < start;\n  if (descend ? step < 0 : step > 0) {\n    // If `step` is fractional, we may multiply it to get more exact results.\n    var multipliedStep = step;\n    var factor = 1;\n    // Only do extra work for fractional `step` values.\n    if (step % 1 !== 0) {\n      var exponentParts = step.toExponential().split('e');\n      // If the step looks inexact already, and would result in a very large\n      // `factor`, don't even attempt to get more exact results.\n      if (exponentParts[0].length < 16) {\n        multipliedStep = +(exponentParts[0].replace('.', ''));\n        // We know `factor` should be a power of ten. Do we need to potentially\n        // use `round` or `floor` here to ensure this float division doesn't\n        // screw that up?\n        factor = multipliedStep / step;\n      }\n    }\n    var multipliedStart = start * factor;\n    var sum = start;\n    var i = 1;\n    while (descend ? sum > stop : sum < stop) {\n      result.push(sum);\n      sum = (multipliedStart + i * multipliedStep) / factor;\n      i++;\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n@zachhale, you'll be happy to see that with this, `range(0, 0.6, 0.1)` gives `[ 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 ]`. All the other methods I tried didn't. :)\n",
