    "body": "Hello, \n\nI have an idea of a useful feature for lodash. Sometimes we have a lot of data and we want to make operations on it (map) and then find any one of them who satisfy some predicate (find). But I remarked that the lazy evaluation is not lazy at all (maybe I'm not using it correctly). I think when we do map followed by a find (or any) we should check the predicate as soon as we have one value available. Currently in lodash we wait for the map to be finished for all values. \n\nIn a more formal we we can say that\n\n```\na.map(f).find(p)  = a.find(f°p) \n```\n\nI know this is true only if we assume that f does not produce any side-effects (maybe it is the reason why it is not implemented already) but the second one is much faster.\n\nDo you think it would be a good idea ?\n\nI didn't dive into the code yet but I think it would be easy. (I assume the chaining of operations are implemented using a stack of operations that are only called when value() is called). We just need to check when value() is called if such a pattern happens and replace the operations in the stack.\n\nI know some functional languages already do this kind of optimization (scala which has also the problem with side-effects).\n\nBest regards\n",

I'm currently using other libraries which support unified iteration between object/map but it'd be great if this were a case lodash could support.\n\nIf performance is a concern, perhaps it could be opt-in as a superset of collection?\n\n``` js\nimport forEach from 'lodash/iteration/forEach'\n```\n",

I've discovered that that `find()` is now returning an undefined result, presumably because it tries to access the element by index _after_ my iterator function mutates the collection.\n\nLooking through the documentation, I can find no mention of mutating iterators. If this approach is more performant, I'm fine with it; but it should probably be mentioned in the documentation which Lodash function-arguments are expected to be pure, and which can mutate the environment Lodash operates in.\n",

    "body": "I use CoffeeScript (yes, still, in 2015. :P) A _huge_ reason I loved CoffeeScript was how beautiful CoffeeScript's implicit indentation and short function syntax is when combined with many of the Lodash tools:\n\n```\n_(@content).remove (entry)->\n   return false if accessor? and entry.accessor != accessor\n   _(entry.masks).remove (m)-> m.conflictsWith mask\n   return true if entry.masks.length == 0\n```\n\nUnfortunately, with Lodash 3.0.0's lazy chains, a huge quantity of my code now breaks. The explicit fix would be to replace _all_ of my CoffeeScript using Lodash with something more like the following:\n\n```\n_(@content).remove((entry)->\n   return false if accessor? and entry.accessor != accessor\n   _(entry.masks).remove((m)-> m.conflictsWith mask).commit()\n   return true if entry.masks.length == 0\n).commit()\n```\n\nI find this a hell of a lot uglier (and this is a simple example, with only two nested Lodash iterators; I've got situations where several happen _on one line_!). I understand the rationale for the lazy-by-default / chain-by-default; but in addition to the existing `_.chain()` (which explicitly _enables_ method-chaining), I'd like to see something like `_.just()` that explicitly disables chaining on the wrapped object (and a correspondingly `_.proto.just()` to explicitly disable chaining on a pre-existing wrapped object).\n\nWith that, I could do something like the following:\n\n```\n__ = _.just\n\nfunc = ->\n   __(object).iterator (ele)-> maipulate ele\n```\n\n… and boom, all the beauty of CoffeeScript's implicit functions and implicit returns is restored to me.\n",

    "body": "It would be useful if I could call `union()` on an array of arrays. The scenario is, I have a wrapper, and the chained calls generate an array of arrays:\n\n``` javascript\nvar coll = [\n    { first: true, second: true },\n    { first: true, second: true },\n    { first: true, second: true }\n];\n\n_(coll).map(_keys).value();\n// →\n// [\n//   [ 'first', 'second' ],\n//   [ 'first', 'second' ],\n//   [ 'first', 'second' ]\n// ]\n```\n\nSince I don't want duplicates, I can do this:\n\n``` javascript\n_(coll).map(_keys).flatten().uniq().value();\n// → [ 'first', 'second' ]\n```\n\nIt would be cool if I could just shorten it to:\n\n``` javascript\n_(coll).map(_keys).union().value();\n```\n\nAlso seems a little more obvious what the code is doing. Anyway, just an idea, I'm sure there are other use cases for using union in chained calls like this, I wasn't sure how feasible something like this is (`union()` accepting a collection of arrays in addition to array arguments).\n\nThanks!\n",

This is consistent, I think, with the documentation (\"This method supports comparing arrays, booleans, Date objects, numbers, Object objects, regexes, and strings.\") suggesting it may be intended behavior. Then again, even the \"name\" property gets ignored, so it doesn't seem to compare functions as regular objects either.\n\nI don't know how much importance is given to consistency between Lodash methods and their analogs in Underscore -- so this may be irrelevant -- but I was surprised to find _.where gave such different results.\n\nIf it is a deliberate design decision, what's the reasoning behind it?\n",

    "body": "I noticed some inconsistencies in methods newly added to the API. `_.propertyDeepOf()` internally uses `resultDeep()` while `_.propertyDeep()` uses `basePropertyDeep()`. One implementation calls function encountered in the key path, passing the result as the object of subsequent key lookups. The other returns the reference to functions it encounters.\n\n``` javascript\nvar object = Object,\n  keys = ['prototype', 'toString'];\n_.propertyDeep(keys)(object);\n// => function toString() { [native code] }\n_.propertyDeepOf(object)(keys);\n// => \"[object Object]\"\n```\n\nAfter looking at `_.property()`, I'm guessing the intended behavior is to **not** invoke encountered functions. To reconcile the results of these methods I generalized `basePropertyDeep()` to suit both methods by returning the property at the end of the key path rather than a function. This allows the method to be used by both `_.propertyDeep` & `_.propertyDeepOf` which each create their own functions.\n",

Is this because the native way of doing this is good enough or these type of functions don't fit in with lodashs design?\n\nFor example; `_.replaceAll('abcdefg, 'abc', 'x')` would cover something like\n\n``` javascript\nvar string = 'abcdefg';\nstring = string.replace(new RegExp('abc', 'g'), 'x');\n```\n\nIt was just a `question` as I'd imagine this has been considered before but I couldn't find the issue in the history. It'd be nice to chain something like that in some instances.\n\n@jh3y\n",

Those cases could generate an error when an\n  // anonymous define() is called outside of a loader request.\n  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n    define('underscore', [], function() {\n      return _;\n    });\n  }\n```\n\nFrom the [lodash source code](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js#L11782-L11787):\n\n```\n  // Some AMD build optimizers like r.js check for condition patterns like the following:\n  if (typeof define == 'function' && typeof define.amd == 'object' && define.amd) {\n    // Expose lodash to the global object when an AMD loader is present to avoid\n    // errors in cases where lodash is loaded by a script tag and not intended\n    // as an AMD module. See http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#mismatch for\n    // more details.\n    root._ = _;\n\n    // Define as an anonymous module so, through path mapping, it can be\n    // referenced as the \"underscore\" module.\n    define(function() {\n      return _;\n    });\n  }\n```\n",

    "body": "As mentioned in [#1076](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/1076#issuecomment-86063939), the \"T\" links in the documentation do not work.  Right now there are 207 instances of `<a href=\"#array\" title=\"Jump back to the TOC.\">&#x24C9;</a>` in the markup.  None of those links work because there is no element with an `id` attribute of `array`.  Additionally, it doesn't make sense for them to all be the same link.  I'm assuming something is just going wrong in the documentation generation step.  This is a useful feature generally, but of even more benefit on mobile.\n\nThree things are needed to fix this:\n- each TOC item needs an `id` attribute (not including the aliases)\n- each \"T\" link needs to change the `href` attribute from `#array` to the above-mentioned `id` values\n- (optionally) some kind of visual affordance to signify the jump\n\nI mocked up [an example of how this could work](http://lodash-docs-work.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs-toc/).  I added the yellow highlight just to indicate what happened.  I tested in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.\n\n_(Seriously, tell me to stop if these are coming too fast.  Your roadmap doesn't mention documentation right now, so I don't want to take anyone off track.  I love lodash.  You guys are making my job so much better.  Thank you.)_\n",

Was there a reason this behavior was chosen (I don't see a test case which is immediately relevant, so perhaps it's an edge case)? This behavior can be changed by iterating backwards instead of forwards, I believe. Either way, perhaps could use some documentation - would be happy to submit a PR.\n",

    "body": "_(Let me know if the documentation things I'm bringing up are getting too much.)_\n\nIn trying to mock up some changes to the presentation of `iteratee` and `predicate` information, I wanted to address something that's been driving me up the wall:  On desktop, when you are reading one part of the documentation and then click a link to another function, you can't use the Back button to return to what you were just reading.\n\n**Example:** [go here](https://lodash.com/docs#forEach), click on the link in the function's description to `_.forIn` or `_.forOwn` and then click Back.  Nothing happens.  This presents for me on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and IE 10.  Due to the media queries present, this does not present on mobile, or likely any viewport narrower than 960px.\n\nThis breaks normal browser behavior and can be frustrating to someone just learning lodash.  You see a link, try to figure out what it means, then go ba...wait...what was I looking at again?  Expected behavior would be something like clicking an inline link to a footnote on Wikipedia, then returning to your place with the Back button.\n\nThe underlying problem is that (on desktop) the `doc-container` is a scrolling div, which the browser can't reset the position of; I'm assuming that it can only reset the position of `body` when going back.  I would like to propose some CSS to fix this that handles the markup in a way that respects the semantics of the page while laying out `position` differently.\n\n[See here for a live example](http://lodash-docs-work.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/) of the proposed fix.  The actual [changed CSS file is here](http://lodash-docs-work.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/_css/main.css).  You will find four references to `@venning` in the comments.  I can explain the thinking for those changes a little more if you'd like, but this is already a lot of prose for a small issue.\n\nThere should be no visual difference in this fix when rendered, except that this positions the main scrollbar a little more naturally across the entire height of the page instead of being a little cut off at the top; \"naturally\" being a personal preference.  Also, there will be purple blur under the chrome when scrolling in Safari but, again, that should feel natural.\n\nI feel like I'm missing some edge case, so let me know if anything looks wonky.\n",

It is a requirement of lodash to fully emulate underscore API ? \n\nThanks in advance - any workaround for this is very appreciated and sorry if this is not an issue. :)\n\nP/D: I also test this in 'compat' mode - this is running 'lodash compat'  but without luck.\nP/D: this behavior is reproducible in older (1.5) and latest (1.8) underscore versions\n",

    "body": "(Referencing #1049, this is something that I encountered as well.)\n\nAfter noticing a mix of `iteratee` parameters with `predicate` descriptions, I repurposed the documentation checker to look for offending descriptions.  The following all take `iteratee` as a parameter but reference `predicate` in their descriptions:\n- [`_.uniq`](https://lodash.com/docs#uniq)\n- [`_.countBy`](https://lodash.com/docs#countBy)\n- [`_.groupBy`](https://lodash.com/docs#groupBy)\n- [`_.indexBy`](https://lodash.com/docs#indexBy)\n- [`_.map`](https://lodash.com/docs#map)\n\nThe current documentation on lodash.com contains more examples of this than those five, but the current codebase seems to have fixed all but these five.  There are no examples of the opposite problem (`predicate` for `iteratee`).  [Script for checking this here](https://gist.github.com/venning/55173b5e5f80aea39995).\n\n_I noticed the use of `@param-` to hide params that are used only for functional purposes.  Doctrine does not parse them correctly, which is probably the point.  There are no `iteratee` or `predicate` params hidden this way, as far as I can tell.  If there are other subtleties to the documentation that affect this, I missed them._\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, I had a similar idea to @octref's regarding [pulling out the verbatim descriptions](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/1049#issuecomment-79081841) of `iteratee`, `predicate`, etc and replacing them with references describing how to use them.  My tendency when reading the docs is to assume that the lines are repeated because they are subtly different between individual functions, with some sort of function-specific nuance.  That means I read them each time, which is slow and, assuming they are in face identical, unnecessary.  I can mock up an example or two of how to represent this differently, if there's desire.\n",

    "body": "Hey, I've noticed there are some bugs related to the .matches behaviour (#892, #899, #909, #937,  #939, #945 ). It does feel very weird. It works but makes lodash very messy conceptually. It seems that .matches is really .matchesOwnProperties, just with a misleading name and description (_\"returns true for elements that have the properties of the given object\"_ should probably be something like _\"returns true for elements that have the properties of the given object as their own, non-inherited properties\"_). It might be the most natural way to match objects (although opinions will probably vary) but certainly not the most general. It's a bit like naming a function .isAnimal while it only works for mammals. This confusion is amplified by the fact that there's .matchesProperty which is more specific than .matches in one aspect (finds only a single property) but more general in that it looks for both own and inherited properties. \n\nThis also means that suddenly most examples only show part of the story (they all use own properties where there's little difference), and to show how a function behaves would require to show cases where both types of properties (own and inherited) are defined. Again, this shows that the use of lodash got much more complex, and being able to just read an example and know what a function does was a great thing, especially for people who are new to it. \n\nOn top of this before someone uses something like find he needs to understand much more about lodash implementation and also make sure any object he or she might be looking for is not using inheritance (which is ok in case they are created by you, but in fact requires checking the internals of any library you might be getting objects from (at least by hasOwnProperty)). So even if someone knows the difference between .matches and .matchesProperty going from searching by a single property to matching by 2 is suddenly a whole big thing, and even when searching by a single property the difference between these two is a debugging nightmare waiting to happen:\n`_.result(_.find(users, 'active', false), 'user');`\n`_.result(_.find(users, {'active': false}), 'user');`\n",

    "body": "After noticing an error in one of the **documentation examples**, I ran them all through a script and found a few more.  There are small errors in three examples that I can fix:\n- [the example for **`_.trim`**](https://lodash.com/docs#trim) is missing a single-quote\n- [the example for **`_.matchesProperty`**](https://lodash.com/docs#matchesProperty) is using the wrong starting `users` object to produce the stated result\n- [the example for **`_.property`**](https://lodash.com/docs#property) is missing a single-quote\n\nThere are also errors in four more examples that I'm not sure exactly how to fix:\n- [the example for **`_.runInContext`**](https://lodash.com/docs#runInContext) assumes that `_.add` doesn't exist by default, which is no longer true as of v3.4.0; so the example not only makes less sense, it also shows `lodash.isFunction(lodash.add);` returning `false` when it will now return `true` in the current version; I'm not sure what would make a better example\n- [the example for **`_.thru`**](https://lodash.com/docs#thru) errors when `_.last()` returns a `Number` and then tries to call the `thru` method of that `Number`; I have no idea what you're trying to do with that example, so I have no suggestions on how to correct it\n- [the example for **`_.forEachRight`**](https://lodash.com/docs#forEachRight) states that it \"returns the array\", but it actually returns a concatenation of the array's contents care of `Array.prototype.join`; this is probably a copy-and-paste from `_.forEach` where the final chained call is to `_#value`; not sure if you'd rather change it back to `_#value` or fix the result description\n- [the example for **`_.escapeRegExp`**](https://lodash.com/docs#escapeRegExp) does not show _slashes_ being escaped, which is matched by the description which also does not list _slashes_ as being escaped; but [the codebase shows](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/lodash.src.js#L120) _slash_ being part of `reRegExpChars`; the documentation links to this [article on `RegExp` characters](http://www.regular-expressions.info/characters.html#special) which does not list _slash_ as special; either the documentation and example need to show _slash_ as being escaped or the code needs to remove _slash_ from the characters that are escaped\n\nMy assumption is that you are using `lodash.src.js` for the codebase and deriving documentation from that.  If that's the case, I'll submit a pull request for the first three fixes and either let you fix the next four or I'll submit a pull request for those on your suggestion on which way you'd like to fix them.\n\n_(I should state that I've never submitted a pull request for an open source project before, so I may be going about this haphazardly.)_\n",

Or maybe a `_.populate` to create an array of default values? I understand what `fill` does, but not _why_ it only does that. Is there a technical (or semantic) reason that `_.fill` can't populate non-existent indices?\n\n(FWIW, `_.fill([0, 0, 0], 'blah', 0, 5)` functions similarly.

Specifically, a groupBy that would group on array fields and allow records to appear in multiple groups.\n\n```\nvar multiValuedGroupBy = _.createAggregator(function(result, value, keys) {\n    _.each(keys, function(key) {\n    if (_.has(result, key)) {\n        result[key].push(value);\n    } else {\n        result[key] = [value];\n    }\n    });\n})\n```\n\nSo, `multiValuedGroupBy([{A:[1,2],B:0},{A:[1,3],B:0}], 'A')` produces:\n\n```\n{\n     \"1\":[{\"A\":[1,2],\"B\":0},{\"A\":[1,3],\"B\":0}],\n     \"2\":[{\"A\":[1,2],\"B\":0}],\n     \"3\":[{\"A\":[1,3],\"B\":0}]\n }\n```\n\nI couldn't just make a `multiValuedGroupBy` mixin because I needed access to createAggregator.\n",

    "body": "If I understand correctly, to maximize the benefits of Closure Compiler's dead code removal, I should compile lodash together with my own code, so that the compiler knows which lodash functions to keep around. (I know I can make a custom build of lodash with only the needed functions, but I'm hoping to let the compiler keep track of them.) Is this possible?\n\nI'm assuming that lodash supports the Closure Compiler because the lodash-cli tool uses the Closure Compiler on lodash.\n\nI tried concatenating the lodash.js file from the github release to my code and running the compiler on that, and the compiler complained about undeclared variable \"module\" in \"var freeModule = objectTypes[typeof module] && module && !module.nodeType && module;\". (It may be relevant that I run the compiler with --warning_level=VERBOSE.) I could try adding \"module\" as an extern, but I thought I'd ask for an \"official\" solution before trying hacks.\n",

    "body": "The readme doesn't tell much about what lodash can do. It can be very helpful for people that just discovered lodash to have a list of features.\n\nAlso, as lodash is becoming more popular than underscore, we shouldn't asume that people know what underscore is in the website. Instead of saying \"Features not in Underscore\" we can say \"Features in lodash\" and then highlight in some way the ones that are lodash exclusive.\n\nI can help with this, but my english is not very good.\n\nThank you for the excellent library!\n",

Although, lodash has about 300 functions. Remembering what they do is kind of hard. I keep lodash docs website opened without closing it for few months already.\n\nTrying to teach a student I always find that it's really hard for them to remember what some of the lodash functions purpose is. Map and reduce names is something people can remember. It's good you introduced new `all` and `any` aliases. But there are few very short misleading names. Especially for newbies.\n\nExamples. (It's just a quick list. I did not think about the names much.)\n\nArray:\n- `_.rest` -> the better name would be `_.allButFirst`.\n- `_.zipObject` -> `_.composeObject`.\n- `_.reject` -> `_.allBut` or/and `_.filterNot`.\n- `_.sample` -> `_.pickRandom`.\n- `_.after` and `_.before` -> `_.invokeAfter` or `_.callBefore`.\n- `_.ary` -> confusing as hell. `_.acceptMaxArgsNumber`. Yeah, a very long one.\n- `_.bindKey` -> `_.bindObjectFuncToArgs`\n- `_.curry` -> `_.waitAllArgs`.\n- `_.flow` -> too generic name. `_.invokeSequential` or kind of would be more clear.\n- `_.momoize` -> `_.cacheCallResult`.\n- `_.once` -> `_.invokeOnce`.\n- `_.rearg` -> `_.rearrangeArguments`.\n- `_.functions` -> `_.getObjectFunctions`.\n- `_.invert` -> `_.invertKeysWithValues`.\n- `_.keys` -> would be good to have alias `_.ownKeys`. Same for `_.ownValues`.\n- `_.keysIn` -> same reasoning, `_.allKeys`. Same for `_.allValues`.\n- `_.mapValue` -> this one is very clear actually. I wish all the rest were like it.\n- `_.omit` -> `_.cloneExcept`.\n- `_.pick` -> `_.cloneOnly`.\n- `_.pair` -> `_.keyValuePairs`.\n- `_.attempt` -> `_.getResultOrException`.\n\nI understand that JS code doesn't like long names because traffic and typos. Although, people do better (functional) programming when function names do not allow many interpretations.\n\nI am looking for a way to solve this issue. Any ideas?\n\nP.S. I understand that I can create and maintain a separate module like \"lodash-long-names\". `require('lodash-long-names').assignAliases(_);`. Although, I think it's better to keep lodash activities under the same brilliant umbrella of @jdalton.\n",
