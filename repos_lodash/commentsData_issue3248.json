    "body": "I'm a bit confused. If I understand the documentation correctly...\r\n\r\n> Creates a throttled function that only invokes func at most once per every wait milliseconds\r\n\r\n...a `func` throttled with any options should be called 'at most once per every wait milliseconds'\r\n\r\nSo it's already not my case (in my example throttled function was called with an interval less than 'wait')\r\n\r\nSpeaking about `leading` and `trailing` options, I beleive they configure behaviour which I want to keep default. When I run this code:\r\n```js\r\nthrottledAsyncFn(throttledAsyncFn)\r\n```\r\nI expect asyncFn to be called immediately at first time, and after `wait` ms (when it'll be fired from callback).\r\n\r\nIn other words:  I expect this code:\r\n```js\r\nthrottledAsyncFn(throttledAsyncFn)\r\n```\r\n to call a `asyncFn`  in the same way as the following code does:\r\n```js\r\nsetInterval(throttledAsyncFn, 10)\r\n```\r\ninterval version: https://codepen.io/Int0h/pen/jwveKV?editors=1111 (it works fine by the way) \r\n\r\nAnyway I've tried `leading` and `trailing` options:\r\n\r\n- when `trailing` is set to `false` it fires only once (https://codepen.io/Int0h/pen/YQOJYB?editors=1111)\r\n- when `leading` is set to `false` it fires almost as I expect but it does not fire immediately (https://codepen.io/Int0h/pen/mwGzrv?editors=1111). This is pretty reasonable (due to leading=false) but I don't want to skip leading invocations.\r\n\r\n",
