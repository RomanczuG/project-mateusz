    "body": "> The only problem with the npm -g is the way the repository is currently set up via submodule and the like, you can't leverage the build without cloning and initializing the repository submodules\n\nBummer. Lets do what is needed to make it work ;D\n\n>  What are your thoughts on making this work in the real lodash.\n\nI can dig it.\nSo instead of `node build include=each,map,filter` it would be `lodash include=each,map,filter` ? I'm not familiar with naming conventions for build setups and not sure if it makes sense for `lodash` to equate to a build command but other than that I'm cool with it.\n",
