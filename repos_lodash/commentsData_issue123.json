    "body": "This might be the offending part:\n\nhttps://github.com/bestiejs/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js#L244-L246\n\n``` javascript\nlodash(value) {\n  if (value && value.__wrapped__) {\n    return value;\n  }\n  // ...\n```\n\nIf you pass a literal \"foo\" to the lodash function, it will check for `wrapped` on \"foo\", which is a very slow operation for literals/primitives. I'd use something like:\n\n``` javascript\nif (value && typeof value == 'object' && value.__wrapped) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAnyway strings aren't typically used in lodash :-)\n",
