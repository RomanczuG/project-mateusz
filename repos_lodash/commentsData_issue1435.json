Our chaining syntax, while a closer fit, relies on chaining on certain chaining methods to exist too. It's an awkward fit. I could see getting support via a wrapper of some kind but that means more upfront work. \n\nSince this is all experimental syntax it could be solved by proposing a bind operator that works with our generic pattern with the `this` as the first argument.\n",

    "body": "> Since this is all experimental syntax it could be solved by proposing a bind operator that works with our generic pattern with the this as the first argument.\n\nThe proposal has settled down and judging by zenparsing/es-function-bind#19 it's unlikely that the proposal will ever include an alternative syntax that binds to the first-argument instead of `this`. Doing so would likely make it impossible to convince the TC39 committee to standardize it.\n\nlodash supports a wide variety of custom builds and does a bunch of processing on the code, including breaking it up into modules, in multiple formats including es6 modules; shouldn't it be possible in some way to create a build mode that exports functions that use `this` in place of the first arg?\n\nThen we'd have `lodash-bind` and `lodash-es-bind` packages to use.\n\nThe effect of doing that would be really, really advantageous.\n\n``` js\nimport { chunk } from 'lodash-es-bind';\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n  .map(i => i * i)\n  ::chunk(2)\n  .forEach(([a, b]) => {\n    // ...\n  });\n```\n\nIn this (naturally poor hypothetical but useful nonetheless) example, if you used rollup and babel, once rollup/rollup#45 is fixed, rollup would end up tree-shaking every part of lodash not used to make `chunk` work resulting in a very small bundle size.\n\nThe key points here are:\n- You get a small build only including what you require\n- The import is a one-liner: if you wanted more than `chunk` you would not need a separate `import`\n- You get the advantages of chaining: Even though `_(...)` is not used; as a bonus you also get to chain off of native methods without ugly wrapping\n\nEvery alternative compromises that in some way.\n- You can chain nicely using a one-line import using `_(...)` but tree-shaking becomes practically impossible\n- You can get small bundles with `lodash/foo` imports, but even if you wrapped them so you could using es-function-bind you'd have a pile of ugly imports at the top\n- You _could_ tree shake a one line `lodash-es` import with rollup but you don't get to chain it\n",
