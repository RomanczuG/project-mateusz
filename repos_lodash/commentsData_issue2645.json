Don't have time for a reduced test case right now, but both the transform and the plugin seem to be loaded correctly (if absent either browserify or babelify throw an error)\n\nThis is in my package.json:\n\n``` json\n{\n\n  \"browserify\": {\n    \"transform\": [\n      [\n        \"babelify\",\n        {\n          \"plugins\": [[\"lodash\", { \"currying\": true, \"placeholders\": true }]]\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso I thought that those plugins were only useful to avoid having to load files separately (`lodash/fp/pick`) rather than remove unused imports.

    "body": "> \"Some overhead\" shouldn't be that much, I even see a memoize in there.\n\nDeep partial matching of [_.matches](https://lodash.com/docs#matches) and [_.matchesProperty](https://lodash.com/docs#matchesProperty) aren't cheap. It's the primary reason I created the Webpack plugin. That said, if you use a handful of methods the cost evens out a bit more.\n\nI wrote a plugin for Webpack because it had the process and exposed the hooks needed to rewire modules. FWIW Rollup and Webpack 2 still don't tree-shake Lodash properly so you'll still need to use [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash).\n\nIf you'd like to create a Browserify or Rollup plugin that consumes [lodash-webpack-plugin/src/mapping](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin/blob/master/src/mapping.js) that would be rad!\n",
