    "body": "Hey @jdalton,\n\nIt seems to me that `_.orderBy` and `_.sortBy` are limited in that you can't provide a custom comparator for two values. It seems that you are instead forced to produce a value for each iteratee that can be compared with the `<` and `>` operators. Is there some sort of workaround that I'm missing?\n",
