    "body": "@jdalton Ah got it, thanks!\n\nFrom [the criteria](https://lodash.com/docs#_)\n\n> Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut fusion if the section is applied to an array of **at least 200 elements** and any iteratees accept only one argument\n\nIt would be nice if the heuristic was configurable.  I've updated my enhancement request to reflect.\n\n**My use case**\n\nSomewhat expensive filter method. 99%+ of calls expected to return the first 10 results of an about 100 item array. In very rare cases slice may not fill up so full execution may happen. It effects initial rendering of a page that's locked by this calculation, so deciseconds count, but if the occasional user has a slow response it would be okay.\n\n**My workaround**\n\nOptimized my filter method at the cost of code complexity\n",
