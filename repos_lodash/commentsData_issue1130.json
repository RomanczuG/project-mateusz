    "body": "Hi @arthurkhu! The others have expressed the gist of why I wouldn't do this. The method should accept falsey values and we want to ensure if an array is passed and is empty that it doesn't access the `-1` property. The performance gain is insignificant (millions compared to more millions of operations a second) so there's no clear win to changing the behavior.\n",
