    "body": "Hi @xswordsx! We currently maintain [a separate branch](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/npm) which has the built version of lodash for publishing to npm. The npm package already has all unnecessary files removed (tests, vendor files, etc.). The additional file size youâ€™re seeing is due to separate files for each module (eg. `lodash/each`).\n",
