    "body": "Hi @hyphaene!\r\n\r\nI originally started out with a monolithic build and used the hand crafted [lodash-cli](https://lodash.com/custom-builds) to split it up. However, this tightly coupled `lodash-cli` to the Lodash source and made maintenance a pain. So for v5 I made one last modular build then retired `lodash-cli`. Now that we have modules we can use a bundler, like webpack, to mush them together when needed.",
