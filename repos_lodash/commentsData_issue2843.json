    "body": "Hi @kaelig!\r\n\r\n> Expected: `string1` (maybe? - againâ€¦ I couldn't find a spec)\r\n\r\n`_.kebabCase`, like other casing methods, relies on `_.words` to separate compound words.\r\nThe specs are with `_.words`. After all, it'd be a bit goofy to duplicate the same test 6 times when it comes down to 1 method.\r\n\r\n> The npm package `kebab-case` seems to consider `string` and `1` are part of a single word, and returns `string1`.\r\n\r\nWhy are you using the `kebab-case` package, a package with 2 commits, 5 tests, and released a year after Lodash introduced `_.kebabCase`, as your standard by which you measure Lodash? It seems kind of arbitrary.\r\n\r\nWe treat numbers as separate in most cases:\r\n```js\r\n'walk500Miles' // is treated as words \"walk 500 miles\"\r\n'12ft' // is \"12 ft\"\r\n'tooLegit2Quit' // is \"too legit 2 quit\"\r\n'isISO8601' // is \"is ISO 8601\"\r\n```\r\nThe exceptions are ordinals:\r\n```js\r\n'1st' // is '1st'\r\n'14th' // is '14th'\r\n```\r\n",

It seems kind of arbitrary.\r\n\r\nYou're right, absolutely arbitrary! Again, I couldn't find a spec so I looked around npm and found this other package.\r\n\r\nThe reason I asked is I have a use-case where `string1` needs to be kept as is, while transforming the rest of the set of strings as kebab-case, which I think I'll treat as an edge case instead of using the kebabCase function since there's no spec.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your answer and thanks for the awesome work on Lodash!",
