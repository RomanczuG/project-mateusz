    "body": "Function `merge` is to combine two objects, so merging two arrays is not its intentional purpose.\r\nIf you want to merge two or more array, look into `concat`.\r\n\r\n**Reasoning for this behaviour.**\r\nAs arrays are also objects in javascript, the behaviour of `merge` is such that it overwrites the values of the key in an object with a value of the same key in another object (most right object with same key takes precedence). \r\nNow in this case the first array `[\"foo\", \"bar\"]` has keys `[\"0\", \"1\"]` (Try it by `Object.keys([1,2,3])` or `Object.keys([\"foo\", \"bar\"])`) which is basically the indices, so by that logic the resulting output makes sense cause the key `0` in the right most object which is `[\"baz\"]` overwrites the value of the same key and as there is no value for key `1` (value `bar`), it remains the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Other objects and value types are overridden by assignment. \r\n\r\nBased on this, the array value of `foo` is merged as if you would merge the array directly ( as seen in your first comment).\r\n\r\nAs suggested previously, take a look at `Object.keys` as well as `_.assign`/`Object.assign` to get a better understanding how arrays behave when \"merged\".
