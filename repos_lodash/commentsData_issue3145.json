    "body": "Hi @harikrishnakanchi!\r\n\r\nPartial right appends arguments from the right it doesn't fill in a fixed arity.\r\nSo if you did\r\n```js\r\nfunction foo(a, b, c) {\r\n  console.log(a, b, c);\r\n}\r\nvar p = _.partialRight(foo, 'c');\r\n```\r\nIt would log\r\n```js\r\np('a'); // logs ['a', 'c', undefined]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind when you apply a wrapper like `partialRight` the arity of the resulting function is `0` so you'll need to specify that as part of `curry`.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is fixed in v4, then great!\r\nElse you might check out [this query](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/search?p=1&q=curryRight&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93). I suspect one of the issues is similar to your own.",
