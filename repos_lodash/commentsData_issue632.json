    "body": "In v3.0 we'll add `lodash-node/modern` to the `lodash` package, e.g. `require('lodash/lang/isEqual')`. We'll solve the load time issue by having the single-file-monolithic-build be the one that's loaded when invoking `require('lodash')` and individual modules for the rest. This keeps the speed of a single load, allows us to support `_.runInContext`, & allows devs to use the individual modules for smaller builds (browserified).\n",
