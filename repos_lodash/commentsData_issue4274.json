If it was odd, then that element is included.\r\n\r\nThe Lodash xor function instead includes elements which are present in only one array.  I agree that this is more useful and intuitive, but the docs shouldn't link to symmetric difference as Lodash xor is objectively not the symmetric difference for any case n >= 3.\r\n\r\nFrom a mathematical and engineering perspective xor is always an odd-hot detector:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7668446/56463518-0b7c6980-63a4-11e9-9810-7103e581de3a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is more liberal, but I think there's a case for changing _.xor() to this behavior, and implementing the current functionality for multiple arrays as input to _.uniq().  Personally, I view the current behavior as closer to _.uniq() than _.xor()",
