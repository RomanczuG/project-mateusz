MIC stands for Market Identification Codes. So the \"s\" in my case doesn't make sense as C stands already for \"Codes\". Thanks for the comments and keep doing great job like you do with lodash!\n\nBut let's say you have MIE that would stand for Market Identification Entry, you would be tempted to add a \"s\" to make MIEs and then it doesn't work out anymore.
