    "body": "Oh, super interesting. The freeze happens on the comparison bit `>= 1`.\r\nIt can be reproed simplified to `_() >= 1`. The key is `>= n`.\r\n\r\nIt looks like it goes back to at least v2 and affects Underscore too. It doesn't seem to matter if there's a `toNumber` or `toString` method set on the compared instance. Since this is a far reaching and old bug we'll probably not address it. I'll still try to root cause it and report it to Microsoft.",
