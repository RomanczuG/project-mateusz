    "body": "Hi @glasser!\r\n\r\nThe documentation example for `_.iteratee` covers the custom iteratee case. The doc examples for several other methods cover various iteratee shorthands too. I removed the type annotations for the shorthands since it cluttered up the docs for each method. I'm relying on usage examples plus doc references to get the gist across on the meaning of an iteratee.",

I think a simple sentence added to the `_.iteratee` documentation saying something this would be nice:\r\n\r\n>Whenever a Lodash method takes an \"iteratee\" as an argument, that argument is converted to a function using this method.\r\n\r\nI would send a PR but it looks like iteratee support is actually gone on master? Which makes this a moot point, I guess.",
