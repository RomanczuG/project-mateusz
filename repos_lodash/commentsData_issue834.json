    "body": "Pretty neat to come up with an implementation that can leverage the optimizations of deferred execution of `_.matches` and the immediate action of an `_.isMatch` method. The `_.matches` method can store the keys and map out which values can use a simple strict equality check but it has to clone the source object to avoid altering its match if the source object is changed. The `_.isMatch` method can't benefit from the stored keys/values/strict-compare-flags but doesn't need to clone the source object.\n",
