    "body": "It's a feature and more consistent as other \"Array\" category methods like Underscore's `_first`, `_.last`, `_.initial`, and `_.zipObject` don't have fail-safes for not passing a required argument. The fail-safes are implemented in the \"Collections\" category methods though I'm not sure if they are really needed either. Underscore is tied to its `_.each` (a \"Collections\" method) when it needs to iterate and so has the side effect of its behavior bleeding into other non collections methods.\n",

The flattening of objects is undocumented/untested and an unintended side effect of Underscore's `_.each` overuse/dependency.\n",

However, I think you juuuust happened to not run into issues as I pointed out other \"Arrays\" methods would have thrown errors.\n\nI will close this for now, but will consider adding a fail safe to all \"Arrays\" methods.\n",
