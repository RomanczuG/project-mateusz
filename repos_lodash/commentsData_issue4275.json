    "body": "Thank you @jdalton!\r\nAnd would you recommend to rely on given lodash instance and hope it will contain all the methods I need?\r\nOr I should cherry pick methods from lodash installed as a dependency?\r\n\r\nIn the first case, the given instance may miss some methods I need if it was optimized somehow.\r\nOr there may be no instance at all if the client code uses babel-plugin-lodash.\r\n\r\nIn another case, if I use cherry-picked from lodash dependency methods, but client code already has these methods in the lodash instance it wants to extend - in the final bundle code will be duplicated?\r\n\r\nProbably I need a dry module for each method, which expects prepared Lodash instance or just an object with required methods, \r\nand also second, a pre-imported module with cherry-picked from lodash methods already passed into dry version?\r\n\r\nAnd finally there will be the main script which accepts Lodash instance, imports 'wet' modules for each extension's methods and mixins it into Lodash?\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think about separate NPM modules per method? Do you think it's an inefficient technique?",

    "body": "Thank you @jdalton, let me please spend some more your time for this, \r\nI think it's useful to determine the optimal strategy for any other lodash extension libraries.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine how usage will look in different cases\r\n\r\nNow it supposed to be `require`d:\r\n```js\r\nconst lodash = require('deepdash')(require('lodash'));\r\n```\r\nimport now looks like this:\r\n```js\r\nimport lodash from 'lodash';\r\nimport deepdash from 'deepdash';\r\nconst _ = deepdash(lodash);\r\n```\r\nfull lodash + cherry-pick from extension + mixin into lodash:\r\n```js\r\nimport lodash from 'lodash';\r\nimport addEachDeep from 'deepdash/addEachDeep';\r\nimport addFilterDeep from 'deepdash/addFilterDeep';\r\nconst _ = addFilterDeep(addEachDeep(lodash));\r\n```\r\nfull lodash + cherry-pick couple of methods from extension + mixin into lodash:\r\n```js\r\nimport lodash from 'lodash';\r\nimport addEachDeep from 'deepdash/addEachDeep';\r\nimport addFilterDeep from 'deepdash/addFilterDeep';\r\nlet _ = addFilterDeep(addEachDeep(lodash));\r\n```\r\ncherry pick from lodash + cherry-pick from extension, no lodash instance\r\n```js\r\n// user actually needs this:\r\nimport flatMapDeep from 'lodash/flatMapDeep';\r\n\r\n// extension method requires this:\r\nimport merge from 'lodash/merge';\r\nimport clone from 'lodash/clone';\r\nimport cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';\r\nimport isArray from 'lodash/isArray';\r\nimport isObject from 'lodash/isObject';\r\nimport each from 'lodash/each';\r\nimport eachRight from 'lodash/eachRight';\r\nimport has from 'lodash/has';\r\nimport set from 'lodash/set';\r\nimport unset from 'lodash/unset';\r\nimport isPlainObject from 'lodash/isPlainObject';\r\n\r\n// user needs this extension:\r\nimport getFilterDeep from 'deepdash/getFilterDeep';\r\nconst filterDeep = getFilterDeep(\r\n  { merge, clone, cloneDeep, isArray, isObject, each, eachRight, has, set, unset, isPlainObject});\r\n```\r\nLooks bad. Latest example is definetly a subject of refactoring/automation.\r\n\r\nAnd if I'll do all this cherry-pick imports inside the es module\r\nso the user will do only:\r\n```js\r\n// user actually needs this 4 lodash methods and he doesn't care about extension's needs:\r\nimport flatMapDeep from 'lodash/flatMapDeep';\r\nimport eachRight from 'lodash/eachRight';\r\nimport has from 'lodash/has';\r\nimport set from 'lodash/set';\r\n// and this extension:\r\nimport filterDeep from 'deepdash/filterDeep';\r\n```\r\nWill these three methods `eachRight`, `has` and `set` both imported by user's code and by `filterDeep` be tree-shaked or duplicated in the final bundle?\r\n\r\nProbably I need to test the latest approach with webpack/rollup first, maybe tree-shaker will handle it, how do you think?\r\nOr I need my own `babel-plugin-deepdash` here?",
