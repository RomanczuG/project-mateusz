    "body": "Hi @evanrs!\n\nAh the joys of mutating arrays. The `push` case is covered in the [changelog](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v300).\nDeferred chaining creates a sequence of actions that can be (re)applied. In this case you're applying the sequence several times over with implicit and explicit `value()`.\n\nTo avoid this break it up:\n\n``` js\nvar wrap = _([]).push(1).push(2)\n\n// apply the pushes and wrap\nwrap = _(wrap.value())\nwrap.find({})\nwrap.find({})\nwrap.value()\n// => [1, 2]\n```\n\nWith things being deferred we could use some sequence APIs to smooth over these areas. I'm open to suggestions for things like an alias for `value()` (maybe `run` or `resolve`), a way to reseed the origin of the sequence (maybe `plant`), & a way to resolve the value & re-wrap (maybe `commit`).\n\nI imagine something like:\n\n``` js\nvar wrap = _([]);\n\n// commit the actions so far and return a wrapper\nwrap = wrap.push(1).push(2).commit()\nwrap.find({})\nwrap.find({})\nwrap.resolve()\n// => [1, 2]\n```\n\nThoughts? Opinions on naming?\n\nRelated to [#730](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/730#issuecomment-72980379).\n",
