    "body": "I want to express gratitude for the incredible work you've done in maintaining Lodash over the years. It's no small feat, and Lodash remains an essential utility for countless developers.\r\n\r\nI understand that dealing with a large number of GitHub issues can be overwhelming, especially when many of them are discussions rather than actual bug reports. To help maintain a productive community around Lodash, I may offer some suggestions:\r\n\r\n**Communication Channels:**\r\nConsider setting up a dedicated discussion forum or a platform like Discord or Slack for users to engage in discussions. This can help keep GitHub issues primarily for bug reports and feature requests.\r\n\r\n**Automate Repetitive Tasks:**\r\nAutomate tasks like responding to common questions using GitHub Actions or bots.\r\n\r\n**Moderation and Labeling:**\r\nAppoint moderators or a team of trusted contributors who can help triage and label issues appropriately.\r\n\r\n**Issue Templates:**\r\nImplement issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions. These templates can guide users in providing the necessary information and context when creating an issue.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'd like to point out that Lodash is still recognized as the number one JavaScript utility library according to [lodash vs underscore vs ramda](https://npm-compare.com/lodash,underscore,ramda). This reflects its importance within the JavaScript ecosystem. Thank you for your hard work to the Lodash project.",
