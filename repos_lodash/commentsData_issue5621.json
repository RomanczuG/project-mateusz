    "body": "Alright, I've figured it out. You're not passing the right `iteratee` parameter (the second parameter). I'm not sure why your function returns `[e, e]` and `[e]`, `_sortBy()` does not have any special behavior when arrays are returned from the iteratee function. All it does is convert all the `e` values into `[e, e]`.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening is, eventually `_sortBy()` calls javascript/s built-in `Array.prototype.sort()`. [Source code.](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/ddfd9b11a0126db2302cb70ec9973b66baec0975/lodash.js#L932)\r\n\r\nYou've passed a function to transform the results from `e` to `[e, e]` (for example, from`'json copy'` to `['json copy', 'json copy']`). Javascript's sort function converts all non-string array members into strings. `String(['json copy', 'json copy']) returns `'json copy,json copy`.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, `json copy,json copy` is alphabetically later than `json copy 2,json copy 2`. So the array is in fact being sorted correctly. The mistake is on your side; you don't want to return `[e, e]` like that. What behavior are you trying to achieve?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@ashuvyaspm45 The difference in results you're seeing when using _.sortBy with the same identity function is due to the behavior of the sorting algorithm used by `Lodash`.\r\n\r\nIn the first case,` _.sortBy(array, (e) => [e, e])`, the identity function returns an array with two elements: the original value e and e itself. When comparing elements during sorting, lodash compares the arrays element by element. Since the arrays have the same length, the first elements are compared, and if they are equal, the second elements are compared. This leads to the sorting order you observed: 'A' comes before 'json copy 1', which comes before 'json copy 2', which comes before 'json copy'.\r\n\r\nIn the second case,` _.sortBy(array, (e) => [e])`, the identity function returns an array with only one element: the original value e. In this case, lodash performs a standard comparison between the arrays themselves. Since the arrays are different instances, they are compared based on their memory addresses or internal references rather than their contents. This comparison results in a different sorting order: 'A' comes before 'json copy', which comes before 'json copy 1', which comes before 'json copy 2'.\r\n\r\nHence, the difference in results is due to how the elements are compared by lodash's sorting algorithm when using arrays as the comparison values.",
