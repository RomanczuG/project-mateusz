    "body": "Hi @jdalton !\r\nThanks for stating it, it wasn't clear for me. However could they be extended to support array, or could new similar methods be added isMatchArrayWith, and mergeArrayWith, as the code should already be there to handle array properties of an object. Consider this maybe as a feature request/wish.\r\nI have many use cases where I need to know if array A of partial objects matches array B of full objects (= A and B must have the same size, all objects of A must have a match in B, irrelevant of order, matching only on the properties the items in A have). I also have such use cases to merge these arrays (= all matched object by a given property such as 'id' should copy properties over to the corresponding B object, non matching objects should simply be appended to the resulting array). I gladly discuss usage, design and api and implementation in private with you, but I'm not yet comfortable with the code base of lodash to propose a push request.\r\nBest regards and thanks for your time,",
