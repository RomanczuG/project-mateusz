    "body": "Yes please! Some of the tests still use a `_.<blah>` and that's no good too. It's okay to drop tests that are clunky to add back later. Lodash v4 and below got into doing magic things that made smaller modular builds harder... like magic string to iteratee conversion and string property path interpolation. V5 will gut all of that out. I'm also wanting to split out collection methods into array-like and object. To no longer have them mushed together.",
