    "body": "I was surprised to learn that lodash cannot yet repeat arrays. If `.times` can shim it, docs for `.repeat` should mention it, and should pre-emptively explain why not arrays.\r\n\r\nI had to split out the relevant code in order to [fix it](https://github.com/mk-pmb/lodash-repeat-arrays-fix1436-pmb-js/commits/master) because I can't easily work on files that huge.\r\n\r\nAs I've gone each step (add array support, add buffer support) in an extra commit you can easily see the impact on assumed cost of operations:\r\n* Using `.concat` to append strings or arrays costs that dot lookup + invocation in each step, and\r\n* supporting the Buffer helper function costs an extra function call in each step. We could however save the `.concat` lookup if we made a special add function for the string case.\r\n\r\nFor max. speed we should use independent functions for strings, arrays and buffers, and the buffer concat function should probably start by creating an array with the requested number of references to the same buffer, then buffer-concatenate it all at once.\r\n\r\nHope it helps, and remember to add the docs spoiler! :-)",
