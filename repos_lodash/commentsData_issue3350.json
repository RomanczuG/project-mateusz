Perhaps the protocol symbols can be multiple separate modules as well, then anyone would be able to mix-and-match?\r\n\r\nI suppose its a bit too much to expect from a stable and established library. I just thought that lodash has the unique opportunity to set precedent here and pave the cowpaths for a new era in JS... one that has a rich protocol ecosystem where all libraries work together.\r\n\r\n",
