    "body": "There is another reason to allow an initializer parameter. It is because the default initializer is `{}` which contains `Object` methods like `toString`. If I want `keyBy` to create a dictionary of my array, I want to be sure it only contains items from the array.\r\nAs it is urrently implemented, the following is always try:\r\n```\r\n'toString' in _.keyBy(myArray, iteratee)\r\n```\r\nSo can you either change the default initializer to `Object.create(null)`, or allow users to provide their custom initializer?",
