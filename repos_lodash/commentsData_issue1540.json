In the case of random, one example is\n     * when the integer range between max and min near or exceed the\n     * MAX_SAFE_INTEGER value then rand will not return the full range that you\n     * may expect: numbers can no longer be represented accurately. Similar is\n     * also true when the values for max and min are small or are not integer\n     * representations: rounding errors can occur. This is not something that\n     * lodash has control over.\n```\n",
