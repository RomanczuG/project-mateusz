    "body": "@AjaxSolutions `crypto.getRandomValues` is cryptographically secure, which ensures a high degree of entropy from the PRNG. It can be used in situations where cryptography is needed on the browser side, which inspired the creation of the W3 Web Cryptography API. Braintree, which offers a SaaS solution for a payment gateway/merchant services, also uses this PRNG for its browser side payments API. The implementation is dependent on the JS engine and uses an OS level entropy source:\n\nFrom the [Web Cryptography API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcrypto-api/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html#RandomSource-method-getRandomValues):\n\n> **Note:** Implementations should generate cryptographically random values using well-established cryptographic pseudo-random number generators seeded with high-quality entropy, such as from an operating-system entropy source (e.g., \"/dev/urandom\").\n\nThere's also a [note on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) about it in the `Math.random` article.\n\n@jdalton I don't think it should be that much work. If performance or choice is an issue, you could just add it as something like `_.csRandom`:\n\n``` javascript\nif ((crypto || msCrypto) && Uint8Array) {\n   return (crypto || msCrypto).getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(1))[0]; // divide by 256 for a number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive)\n}\nelse {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n",
