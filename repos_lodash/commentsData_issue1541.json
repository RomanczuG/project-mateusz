    "body": "One more note: there's still a tricky case that, intuitively, this method still seems to hiccup on (note: so does lodash's current method and a few others I've tried) – but I think might actually be the technically-correct-in-floating-point-land result:\n\n```\n> _.range(0, 7/3, 1/3);\n[ 0,\n  0.3333333333333333,\n  0.6666666666666666,\n  1,\n  1.3333333333333333,\n  1.6666666666666665,\n  2,\n  2.333333333333333 ]\n```\n\nI'm not concerned with intermediate inexact terms – like `5/3` != `5 * (1/3)` – that seems unavoidable whether we sum or multiply, even with error correction. But rather what that leads to: we've picked up an extra result – intuitively there should be 7 items, not 8. It's because of `n`, which after calculating `(7/3) / (1/3)` to be `7.000000000000001` and running `ceil` on that, tells us we should produce 8 results.\n\nEven if we compared the last item to `end`, it'd still tell us everything is OK, because:\n\n```\n> 7 * (1/3) < 7/3\ntrue\n```\n\nSo technically, that last item \"fits\" within the requested range, and the user should have just specified `7 * (1/3)` as their `end`.\n\nOne option that fixes this specific case, but introduces a subtraction (and thus potential error): calculate a sentinel, `end - step`, and on the last iteration, if a previous result has already met or exceeded the sentinel, don't append the last result. Equivalent to: use `floor` instead of `ceil` and after the loop, check if we have room for one more `step`.\n",
