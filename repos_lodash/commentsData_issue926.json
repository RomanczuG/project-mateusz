For example, id in the below example.\n\n``` js\nvar objects = [{ 'id': 1,data:[{...}] }, { 'id': 2,data:[{...}] }],\n    other = [{ 'id': 2 ,data:[{...}] }, { 'id': 3,data:[{...}]  }];\n```\n\nThe intersection of the above two objects based on id should be `{'id':2,data:[{...}]`\nIs it possible to accomplish it ?\n",
