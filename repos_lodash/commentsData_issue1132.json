    "body": "Hi Adam!\n\nWhen you use `_.runInContext()` it would create a fresh `idCounter` but currently we don't have a way to customize it. The method is so simple, and I dig that, I think if push came to shove it could be overwritten with the correct seed. I'll keep an eye on the request though to see if we need to beef up `_.uniqueId`.\n",
