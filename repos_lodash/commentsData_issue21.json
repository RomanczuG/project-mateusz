Because Lo-Dash doesn't have many of the restrictions of Underscore it gives me the opportunity to rethink some of the design (method categories, api, edge cases, etc.). I'm trying to strike a balance between Underscore compatibility and optimizations/clarifications for common usage.\n\nPlease let me know if `_.max(_.values(obj));` will work for you and of any other issues you have in the future.\n",
