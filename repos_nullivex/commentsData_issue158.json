    "body": "I agree that npm version switching should also work in WebStorm without having to re-adjust config entries. The way npm is exposed in nodist v0.8 makes this very hard or at least not very elegant:\nThere's an npm.exe in Nodist\\bin, which is called everytime you run npm and decides at runtime, which npm version should be used. WebStorm apparently wants the path to the npm _directory_, though, which is subject to change.\n\nA quick fix would be to add the required file as a proxy for the npm shim (that's what I meant by \"not very elegant\"). I've written up [a simple node executable to do just that](https://gist.github.com/marcelklehr/c831a5f861bc0a10a58ad3ac7efcae1f). it is untested, though. If you happen to give it a go let me know how it goes! :)\n",
