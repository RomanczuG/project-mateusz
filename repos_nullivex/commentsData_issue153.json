    "body": "Hey again! :)\n\nFirst up, I'm sorry the upgrade caused you so much trouble. Were you able to recover your globally installed modules?\n\nThis means nodist/bin/ is not in your PATH. The only relevant change in the installer is this: https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist/blame/master/build/Nodist.template.nsi#L261 While 0.7.x used to add nodist to the intalling user's PATH, 0.8.x adds it to the System PATH. I'm fishing in the dark here, but it might take a restart (at least of Sublime, perhaps of the entire system) for that to take effect. You could also [try adding <path-to>\\nodist\\bin` to your user PATH](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm). I take it nodist does work when you try to run it from a normally started terminal? \n",
